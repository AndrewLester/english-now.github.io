    <h1>Staying In An American Home</h1>
    <img src="images/Homestays-1.JPG" alt="A student with an American family">
    <p>Many students coming to the Washington, DC area from overseas tell us that they would like to live with an American family while they are studying at English Now!</p>
    <p>Staying with an American family can be a great experience. You can learn about American culture from the family, and in most cases the opportunity to speak English will help you progress faster in your studies. We encourage you to consider a homestay if possible for your visit to the United States!</p>
    <p>English Now! works with a homestay organization called Just Like Home to place our students with families in the area. You can visit Just Like Home’s website at <a href="http://justlikehome.com">justlikehome.com</a> for information about homestays in the Washington, DC area. You can be confident that the team at Just Like Home has lots of experience arranging homestays for international visitors to the area. Just Like Home arranges hundreds of homestays each year.</p>
    <p>The staff at Just Like Home will work with you to understand what kind of housing you're looking for. They will need to know, for example, about how many meals you would like the host family to provide. Their process starts with an online application, which you can access <a href="https://justlikehome.com/secure/hs_app.asp">here</a>.</p>
    <p>If you will be arranging a homestay through Just Like Home, or with questions generally about homestays in the Washington, DC area, you can also email Paul Boesen, English Now!’s Managing Director, <a onclick="emailMe('homestays');">here</a>. We want to make sure that you get the most out of your visit to the U.S., so we encourage you to consider staying with an American family while you study at English Now! and look forward to hearing about your experience!</p>
