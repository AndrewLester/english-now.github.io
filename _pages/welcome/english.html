    <p>Bethesda, Maryland</p>
    <p>Greetings!</p>
    <p>It is a pleasure to introduce you to English Now!, and on behalf of our instructors, students and staff, I would like to express our warm welcome to the school.</p>
    <p>Living and studying in a different country can be an incredible experience. You encounter new people, learn about other cultures, and see the world a bit differently every day. Regardless of what you are called to in life, living in a foreign country and speaking a different language, whether for a short or long term, changes you and enables you to contribute more to the people around you and to the world.</p>
    <p>With this in mind, we would like to welcome you to English Now! We want this school to be a place where you progress faster than you think possible in your English language proficiency. We invite you to work hard as you study here, but we can assure you that in so doing you will feel well supported by our talented instructors and caring staff.</p>
    <p>Several aspects of the English Now! story are worth relating:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Great education.</strong> English Now! offers great language education. Our group classes are exceptionally small â€“ a maximum of six students per class. This small class size affords our students a rich learning environment and also the chance to develop strong relationships. What's more, our instructors enjoy small group classes as much as students do, ensuring our ability to attract and retain some of the top ESL instructors in the Washington, DC area.</li>
        <li>
            <strong>A unique location.</strong> English Now! is located in Bethesda, Maryland, only a few miles from Washington, DC. The area's vibrant international community has enabled us to enroll students from more than 85 different countries in the last three years alone. Few cities are such centers for international discourse, making the school a great place both to learn English and to meet interesting people.</li>
        <li>
            <strong>A special place.</strong> English Now! offers a distinctive warm and welcoming atmosphere. Unlike many language schools, English Now! is not a large company or a franchise. From the moment that you set foot in the school, you will feel our commitment to each and every student that studies with us.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>On a personal note, I have been very fortunate to live in a number of different countries in Asia and Europe and to study other languages, and I know well how exciting yet how disorienting that experience can be. So it is my hope that English Now! might serve you with high quality English language education in a caring, supportive environment, and that we might find here a dialogue (in English of course!) that inspires you to greater things in life.</p>
    <p>It is a pleasure to come alongside our students as they work to achieve their language objectives and support them in that process. We hope that you might join us, for group classes or private lessons, and look forward to meeting you.</p>
    <p>Please let me know if there is anything more that we might do to help make your studies even more successful.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Warmest regards,</p>
    <p>
