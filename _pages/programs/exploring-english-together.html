    <h1>Exploring English Together, Online!</h1>
    <img src="/images/exploring-english-together/poster.jpg" class="aside-image">
    <p>These small group classes&mdash;four students maximum&mdash;engage students in an active, online classroom environment. For the Fall 2020-Winter 2021 term, these classes are designed to support students who do not have many opportunities to use English at their school or in the community during the school year. We hope these classes can help students (and families) to <strong>stay engaged and keep learning </strong>this year!</p>
    <p><strong>TERM AND SCHEDULE. </strong>The term length-continuing through end-January 2021-and class schedules are designed to align with local public schools.</p>
    <p><strong>THEMES. </strong>Students will stay with one instructor through their term. Classes will follow themes: explore language, history, nature, the news, and&mdash;for teens&mdash;careers, travel, and the important world of public health. Our goal is to engage youth in ways that offer hope and inspiration for the future, as students improve their English language skills.</p>
    <p><strong>CURRICULUM. </strong>Many classes incorporate elements of National Geographic Keynote online textbooks. Keynote is designed around topics like music, cities as communities, inspirational human activities, and the creative design process. Additional curriculum for these classes includes explorations of books and literature, Bird Studies, Colonial History in Maryland, Career Development (for teens), Travel in the U.S., Journalism/Looking for Good News, and more. See the full list of curriculum offered below.</p>
    <p><strong>LEARNING OBJECTIVES. </strong>Student participants will build vocabulary and strengthen their use of English, as they think, write, talk, and learn creatively with others in an interactive online classroom. Older students will strengthen critical thinking skills, through active conversation, writing, and activities in thematic courses. These classes are designed to help and support students in being able to actively engage using English in the online class environment this school year.</p>
    <p><strong>ONLINE OR IN THE CLASSROOM.</strong> These classes are designed to be taught online on Zoom. Students from anywhere in the world can join.Later in the academic year, if possible, they will meet in the classroom. If we are able to meet in the classroom, we will offer that option to local students, or students may continue online.</p>
