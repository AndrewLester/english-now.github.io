    <h2>Learn to Write</h2>
    <p>Writing well is challenging for native speakers, making it a skill area that deserves a very special approach for our students. We are grateful to have instructors that love to teach writing. Listen to Peggy Blair talk about learning to write:</p>

    <p>We invite you to consider three approaches to writing, as part of your studies at English Now!</p>
    <h4>Option One: Focus on Writing: Writing Workshops for Specific Purposes</h4>
    </p>
    <p>We offer focused Writing Workshops, for students with specific objectives for their writing. These classes offer significant, personalized writing support for higher-level students that are ready to learn to write well in English.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Academic Writing</strong> (Intermediate to Advanced levels): Ideal for students preparing to study at the university level. Students will practice writing paragraphs and essays, including a pre-writing stage to be followed by a first draft and then a revised final version. Various writing strategies, examples, and exercises will be combined with discussion and critiques of at-home writing assignments. Assignments may include descriptions of objects, places or people; essays organized by chronological order or by order of importance; instructions on how to do or make something; personal as well as business letter writing; narrative/story writing; persuasive writing; and reviews of articles, books or movies. For more information about academic writing for teens, see <a href="files/courses/writing-for-teens.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>

        <li>
            <strong>Creative Writing</strong> (Intermediate to Advanced levels): This workshop will help students explore different kinds of creative writing. Students will keep a journal or diary in which to record their daily experiences, reactions, dreams, etc. They will then write scenes drawn from their lives utilizing such literary techniques as setting, sensory detail, character development, dialogue, and theme. Student essays will typically be 250-750 words in length. In addition, illustrations such as those in Chris Van Allsburg's
            <em>Mysteries of Harris Burdick</em>, paintings by modern artists including Edward Hopper and Andrew Wyeth, or photographs will be used to inspire descriptive writing, scenes with dialogue, poems or short stories.</li>
        <li>
            <strong>Professional Writing</strong> (Intermediate to Advanced levels): Most appropriate for students who are either currently working in a professional capacity or hope to in the future. There will be an emphasis in this workshop on correspondence: letters of request, complaint, introduction, intra-office memos and cover letters. Students will show mastery over writing the different kinds of sentences. They will also practice writing instructions, descriptions, executive summaries and persuasive pieces that might be useful in report preparation in an organizational or office setting. Resumes (curriculum vitae) will be reviewed at student request. For more information about our approach to Professional Writing, see <a href="files/courses/write-now-professional-writing.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.

    <p>
        <strong>Writing Workshop Meeting Times, Registration, and Tuition:</strong> Workshops enroll between one and four students, depending on areas of focus, student interests, and student levels of proficiency. Workshops include one face-to-face session per week, for 45 minutes (if one student), one hour (if two), or 75 minutes (if three or four). Please send us a writing sample, indicate your area of focus, and ask us about meeting times.</p>
    <p>These workshops include significant interaction with the instructor outside of class.In addition to the face-to-face session with your instructor, you will receive comments on your work through email exchanges with your instructor. This is an efficient and very personalized approach, designed to have real impact on your writing. Tuition: $190 per four-week term, for one face-to-face session per week, as well as approximately 45 minutes per week of instructor preparation for each student, including review of and comments on written material. (Note: more intensive writing programs are available, tell us about your needs and interests.)</p>

    <h4>Option Two: Writing in the English Now! Intensive English Program</h4>
    <p>Second, we offer writing workshops as part of our higher-level Intensive English Program groups. These workshops, taught two days per week from 12:45 until 2:00pm as part of our Intensive English Program, provide students with writing practice to balance their language skills and improve their fluency in speaking as well. Students will practice writing simple, compound, and complex sentences, as well as going through the stages of writing paragraphs and essays, including a pre-writing stage to be followed by a first draft and then a revised, fully edited version. Work will be discussed and critiqued in class.</p>
    <p>To learn more, see the description of our <a href="intensive-english-program">Intensive English Program</a> including afternoon workshops and please <a href="/contact">contact us</a> at the school.</p>
    <h4>Option Three: Writing in the English Now! Conversation Plus Model</h4>
    <p>Third, some students in our higher-level Conversation Courses would also like to focus on writing as they advance in their English. For these students, we suggest that students consider adding a one- or two-hour private lesson each week to their Conversation Course as part of our "Conversation Plus" model. For a "Conversation Plus" private lesson focused on writing, half of the time is spent working face-to-face with an instructor, and half of the time with the instructor preparing, reviewing and offering comments on written work, with comments exchanged by email.</p>
