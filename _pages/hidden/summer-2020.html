    <h1>Summer 2020 Programs for Children and High School/University Students</h1>
    <p>We invite you to join our small classes and experience our special approach to learning this summer. Summer 2020 finds us living in a different way because of the global health challenge we are facing. You may be among the many who are still staying safely at home in the Washington, D.C. area. Or perhaps you are joining us from a country now able to slowly return to its way of life.</p>
    <p><strong>Wherever you are, we invite you to join and maintain connection in our school community this summer. Advance in language proficiency, challenge yourself with new ideas, and prepare to thrive in our new world, *together online*.</strong></p>
    <p>See below for information about two Summer 2020 programs, Exploring English Together, Online! and Intensive English for HS/University Students. Questions? <a href="mailto:info@english-now.com?subject=Questions%20Regarding%20Summer%202020%20Programs">Contact us</a> to join an online Information Session, offered every Thursday, 9:00am U.S. Eastern time, or with your questions.</p>
    <p>Please note: for adult students, we will continue to offer all of our programs - online <u>and</u> also as soon as it is safe and possible in the classroom - during Summer 2020. Please see our website and contact us for information about programs for adults.</p>

    <h2 class="centered">EXPLORING ENGLISH TOGETHER, ONLINE! (Youth/Teen Students Grades 1-12)</h2>
    <p>These small group classes&mdash;four students maximum&mdash;re-engage students in an active, online classroom environment.</p>
    <p><strong>Themes.</strong> Classes follow themes: explore history, nature, the news, language, and—for teens—careers and travel. Our goal is to engage students in ways that offer hope for the future, as students maintain and improve their English language skills. For course descriptions of the many thematic classes offered – for both G1-8 and high school students – as well as additional information about the program – click <a href="/programs/exploring-english-together">here</a>.</p>
    <p><strong>Learning Objectives:</strong> Student participants will build vocabulary and strengthen their use of English, as they think, write, talk, and learn creatively with others in the online classroom this summer.</p>
    <p><strong>Online OR in the Classroom.</strong> These classes are designed to be taught online on Zoom OR in the classroom, so students may join from anywhere in the world. If we are able to meet in the classroom, we will offer that option, or students may continue online.</p>
