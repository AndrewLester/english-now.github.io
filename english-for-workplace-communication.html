    <h1>Express Yourself with Confidence in English</h1>
    <img src="images/english-for-professionals.jpg">
    <p>The goal of English Now!’s English for Workplace Communication courses is to help professionals from a variety of fields feel more confident using English in their professional lives. Adjusting to a new workplace in the United States can be challenging, even for native speakers of English. For non-native speakers, even after years of studying English, it can be very difficult to communicate effectively in a professional environment. We provide students with the coaching and practice they need to speak and understand English in typical workplace situations, from the conference room to the break room. Special attention is given to participating in meetings, including asking and answering questions, agreeing and disagreeing, and delivering presentations. Students will learn useful expressions and gain the skills they need to have more fulfilling interactions with their colleagues. Our maximum class size for these classes is six students, and many will be taught as private- and semi-private lessons, so our teachers are able to personalize instruction to meet the needs of each individual student.</p>

    <p><strong>Course Objectives.</strong> Students in English for Workplace Communication courses will gain practice in the following areas:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Asking for clarification, making suggestions, and interjecting appropriately during a meeting</li>
        <li>Agreeing and disagreeing in the course of a conversation</li>
        <li>Designing and delivering presentations with your audience in mind</li>
        <li>Preparing for and responding to questions about your presentation</li>
        <li>Clarifying information that you do not understand during a presentation or meeting</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Level of English Proficiency.</strong> English for Workplace Communication classes are for students from High intermediate to Advanced levels. New students are placed in an appropriate class based on a written and oral assessment.</p>
    <p><strong>Curriculum.</strong> A wide variety of texts and materials are available to instructors working with students in our English for Workplace Communication courses. Instructors may draw on material from Communication in Business, Keynote Series (based on TED talks), Targeting Pronunciation, and Professional Interactions in English. In addition, classes will discuss current news stories related to students’ interests. Each teacher will assess the goals and language level of a particular group before selecting materials. Classes will focus on improving conversational ability while emphasizing listening comprehension skills, vocabulary development, common idiom usage, and practice in pronunciation and intonation.</p>
    <p><strong>Homework.</strong> English for Workplace Communication students at English Now! are encouraged to complete all homework assigned by their teachers in order to enhance progress in learning English. Homework may include short assignments in reading, writing, listening comprehension, grammar, and vocabulary development, as well as preparation for oral communications activities in class.</p>
    <p><strong>Schedules and Duration of Study.</strong> English for Workplace Communication group classes meet twice a week Monday through Friday for two hours per class session, or once a week in our English for Professionals Saturday morning class. Private lessons are of course more flexible. We recommend at least two to three months of instruction for progress in English to be observable. We can generally accommodate students who have business travel commitments or take family vacations—ask about our attendance policy.</p>
