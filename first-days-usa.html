        <p>First Days USA&trade; brings international students from around the world to Washington, DC for intensive English study and programs related to American culture. Students will improve their English language abilities and gain a better understanding of American society.

        <p>Students in First Days USA benefit from Intensive English Program language studies that will build on their English language studies in their home countries; cultural studies programming that will offer direct exposure to the sites and perspectives of the nation’s capital; and a welcoming atmosphere with a host family and on university campuses that will offer meaningful personal exposure to American society.</p>
        <p>International high school and university students are invited to join the program. Continue reading below to learn more about the program and how to apply.</p>
        <h4>Program</h4>
        <p>We look forward to welcoming you to the First Days USA program this summer. This program is designed to offer first-time visitors to the United States a great overall  experience and a great English language study program. (Students who have visited the U.S. before are of course welcome to participate.) The program includes the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Language studies in an Intensive English Program at English Now! Class sizes in this program are very small, maximum six students, making this a great opportunity to advance your English.</li>
            <li>Culture programs and local tourism in Washington, DC</li>
            <li>Stay with a host family, to experience American family and university life with host families</li>

            <li>Breakfasts, lunches &amp; dinners</li>
            <li>Mobile phone for use in the U.S.</li>

        <h4>Intensive English Program</h4>
        <p>The First Days USA Intensive English Program will be taught as an Intensive English Program meeting Monday through Thursday mornings from 9:30 am until 2:00 pm. Students will enroll in an Intensive English Program class at their level of proficiency and build their active vocabularies in conversation on academic topics; address pronunciation issues; develop listening comprehension; and learn about slang. Students will also spend time practicing reading and writing skills. A high beginner level of English language proficiency is required for participation in the program.</p>
        <p>Students with a high intermediate level of language proficiency or above may enroll in a class that will include some TOEFL preparation curriculum. This will be a particularly beneficial option for students planning to study in an American university. Each student will complete an English proficiency test during the application process and will be placed into a class at their level of proficiency.</p>
        <h4>Cultural Programming &amp; Local Tourism</h4>
        <p>Culture programming will start with a two-day orientation program and continue with activities five days per week. The program will offer students the opportunity to meet American students and will address issues including trends in American family life; current topics in American politics; school and university life; typical challenges to international student acculturation; patterns of social life; current topics in American popular culture; and urban, suburban, and rural behavioral norms. Students will examine key themes in American life through supplementary academic modules. Speakers on U.S. History, Law &amp; Politics, American Business, and Volunteerism will integrate classroom lectures, discussions, and visits to Washington-area destinations. These are the kinds of experiences that one can only have in the nation’s capital.</p>
        <p>In addition, students will travel over a weekend to the beautiful Shenandoah Mountains of Virginia for a weekend of camping, hiking, and outdoor education. Understanding the United States requires much more than just visits to its cities, and English Now! is delighted to share some of the country’s natural beauty with visiting students. Students will visit museums and monuments in and around Washington, DC, as part of a calendar of activities. Students will visit the Air &amp; Space Museum, the Jefferson Memorial, the Lincoln Memorial, the National Archives, National Gallery of Art, the National Portrait Gallery, the National Natural History Museum, the U.S. Capitol, the Vietnam War Memorial, the Washington Mall, and the White House. These destinations are among the best-known tourist destinations in the United States. In addition, students will visit the campuses of American University and Georgetown University.</p>
        <p>The program will be taught by English Now! instructors and featured special lecturers.</p>
        <h4>Career Preparation Programs</h4>
        <p>Students studying in First Days USA will engage in weekly visits to area businesses and a government office during their stay in the Washington, DC area. First Days USA career preparation programs will offer them an initial introduction to the success factors in professional life in the United States – and around the world!</p>
        <h4>Accommodations</h4>
        <p>Students will reside with an American family in the Washington, DC area, for part of their time in the U.S, experiencing American culture directly through the “host family” along with a schedule of structured classes and activities. In addition, students will spend part of their time in Washington in a college dormitory environment, with a “host student” who will help them experience American campus life. Host families and host students will also be integrated into in the cultural orientation programs for First Days USA, enabling them to play an active role in the success of students’ first days in the USA.</p>
        <h4>International Partners, Application, Visas &amp; Cost</h4>
        <p><strong>Partners</strong> English Now! was delighted to partner with Rivers &amp; Bridges, an English language school in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan; and Lingua Progress, an English language school in Kazan, Russia, to develop this program for Summer 2015. Lingua Progress’s Administrative Director studied with us during Summer 2013, and one of Rivers &amp; Bridges's lead teachers and administrators was with us during Summer 2014. We would welcome other schools’ administrators to study with us during 2016, and to develop future offerings.</p>
        <p><strong>Application Requirements</strong> Students must be at least 15 when they arrive in the United States. They must be able to demonstrate at least a High Beginner level of English language proficiency, in reading, writing, speaking, and listening. Application Process.
