    <p>Parent Talk is an informal conversation group for parents that meets from September through June on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday mornings. In addition, many students take one or two private or semi-private lessons per week, with their children present, for more formal English language studies. Children from newborn to three years old are welcome. Contact us to ask about summer schedules. Each week we focus on a specific parenting theme, such as feeding, potty training, role of fathers, self-care, discipline, attachment, sleeping, etc. We also often study English language phrasal verbs that relate to parenting. Sometimes short readings are used to guide the discussion on topics that we identify, as a group.</p>
    <p>Please join us to talk about language, culture, and parenting, a topic of interest to so many of our students. For more information about our Parent Talk program, see <a href="/files/courses/parent-talk.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. We look forward to meeting you!</p>
