    <p>Parent Talk is an informal conversation group for parents that meets from September through June on Tuesdays, from 1:30-2:30pm, and on Wednesdays and Fridays from 10-11am. Children from newborn to three years old are welcome. Contact us to ask about summer schedules. Each week we focus on a specific parenting theme, such as feeding, potty training, role of fathers, self-care, discipline, attachment, sleeping, etc. We also often study English language phrasal verbs that relate to parenting. Sometimes short readings are used to guide the discussion on topics that we identify, as a group.</p>
    <p>Please join us to talk about language, culture, and parenting, a topic of interest to so many of our students. For more information about our Parent Talk program, see <a href="/files/courses/parent-talk.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. We look forward to meeting you!</p>
    <p>Parent Talk group classes are led by Carol Madison, Harriet Peck, and Anna Green. Also, please ask about Parent Talk semi-private lessons, for smaller groups - with a more structured curriculum - led by other instructors. More information about Carol, Harriet, and Anna <a href="instructors-and-staff">here</a>.</p>
