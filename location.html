    <h4>Recommended Parking: Waverly Parking Garage</h4>
    <img src="images/location.jpg">
    <p>The <strong>Waverly Public Parking Garage</strong> (look for the large, blue "P" "Bethesda Center" sign) is in front of the school at 7400 Waverly Street, less than 150 feet from the school. This is usually the best place to park. However, at some times of the year, it is difficult to find a parking space in the late morning and at lunchtime. <u>We suggest that you try parking here first. Then, if you have problems parking here, try at other parking locations nearby.</u></p>
    <p><strong>Floors 1-3 are two-hour parking only.</strong> Floors 4-6 are for parking over two hours (unlimited parking). There are a few spots on the first level which are <strong>one-hour parking only</strong>. There are also a few spots on the far end of the garage which are unlimited parking below level four.</p>
    <p>Additionally, there are a few spots reserved for Police Only. Please look for signs in front of parking spaces to be sure you are in the right place. If you have an official state-issued handicapped sticker or license plate, you can park for free <strong>anywhere</strong> in the garage, including handicapped spots. Walk out of the main entrance and across the street to English Now!</p>
    <p>The garage has meters that charge $1.00 per hour on weekdays from 7am-10pm, with <strong>free parking</strong> on weekends and holidays. You can use coins to pay for parking, call to pay with a credit card, or pay by using a smartphone app called <strong>MobileNOW!</strong></p>
    <p>In order to pay using your cell phone, call (240) 777-8740 and talk to a garage employee <strong>(if you are not an Intermediate level English speaker, this may be difficult)</strong>. To make payment easier, you may want to download the app called <strong>MobileNOW!</strong> on your iPhone or Android. You can try this on your own, or please ask us for detailed instructions about downloading and setting up this app. It is somewhat complicated. We would also be happy to help you download this, at the school, when you visit.</p>
