    <h4>Course Descriptions</h4>
    <p>Exploring English Together, Online! courses follow themes. Courses explore history, nature, the news, reading, and—for teens—careers. See course descriptions below. Join us to explore—together—this spring.</p>
    <p><strong>Bird Watching</strong> introduces students to an exciting part of our natural world. Amazing birds can even be found in your own backyard! This course will explore bird identification and location, bird songs with audio, bird behavior and habitats, bird feeding, types of birdhouses, and emergency bird care. We will begin by exploring birds of North America-and looking at bird migratory patterns, we will also take a journey around the world!! Students will also explore activities such as building bird houses or feeders and field guides while keeping weekly notes about birds they discover in their neighborhoods.</p>
    <p><strong>Colonial History and Archeology in Maryland.</strong> This course will provide students with an introduction to what life was like for native people and European colonists in the early days of Maryland. Students will explore artifacts used in early Maryland and found by modern-day archaeologists in St. Mary’s City, Maryland’s first colony.  The eight-lesson course will study four areas of Maryland’s history including Native American life, the voyage from Europe to Maryland, city life, and plantation life. Students will learn about colonial history while also practicing conversational and academic English.</p>
    <p><strong>English for Career Development</strong> is a four-week course for high school students designed to develop skills for future career success. This course will give you the opportunity to explore your personal career path, while building your vocabulary and improving your language skills. In this course, you will inventory your professional interests and skills, learn how to effectively interview for a job using conversational and professional vocabulary, and explore how to communicate and collaborate with colleagues in a workplace.</p>
    <p><strong>Looking for Good News.</strong> The good news in our lives has often been buried in the global news avalanche of heartbreak and devastation resulting from the coronavirus. In this course, students will learn some basic skills to discover, write, and share their own stories of hope outside the COVID-19 realm. Students will be introduced to the significance and variety of news media  stories while reviewing the fundamentals of news writing. As a culminating activity they will organize and present online their own English Now! “Good News” program.</p>
    <p><strong>Reading Together</strong> is an exciting discovery course. Students embark on a journey that takes them to wonderful worlds that may be as close as their backyards, or as far away as distant galaxies. During their excursions, they learn about many wonderful aspects of the world around them while improving their English language skills. These two components (general knowledge & English language) are seamlessly "interfaced.” Students expand the horizons of their understanding, enhancing their English language skills as an added “bonus!”</p>

    <p>Please understand that we are not sure if we can enroll all students that want to join this program. We will try. We want to help as many families and students as we can, but believe that small classes are very important online, so our capacity is limited.</p>
    <p>For children already studying with us, these will be additional classes to add to the current schedule and will probably not be with your child's current teacher.</p>
