        <h2>Business English / Sales</h2>
        <p>Improve your business English quickly through our small, helpful classes! These classes will prepare you for an American workplace and help you develop useful business communication skills. We think about how business works: through negotiations, face-to-face meetings, phone conference calls, formal and informal presentations, negotiations, and some of the nuance one sees in effective persuasive and managerial communications.</p>
        <h4>Growing Your Business Through Sales &amp; Business Development</h4>
        <p>One special area of our emphasis is on growing your business through sales and business development. Using learning-assimilation-facilitation methodology, we can teach a class that examines the vocabulary and techniques of sales. Communication strategies are taught from well-known sales communications curriculum. In these classes, we will also delve into day-to-day news through specialty journals such as The Wall Street Journal. A significant emphasis will be placed on sales role playing and simulation, with content if you like from your business. This class will be taught as a private lesson or, if multiple students are at a similar level of English proficiency and have similar schedules, a semi-private lesson or small group class. Ask about convenient class times in the morning, before work. We would be happy to help you get your day started in a manner that contributes to the long-term success of your business.</p>
        <h4>General Business English Curriculum</h4>
        <p>The needs of students in Business English are as varied as the world of business itself. Whatever your area of interest, ask us about a curriculum and approach to lessons that has the greatest impact on your business. Whether your needs relate to management, marketing, strategy, negotiations, or any other topic, we have carefully surveyed available curriculum to be ready to address you specific needs. Multi-level series such as Market Leader or the Economist Intelligence Unit's curricula, or Professional English materials from Cambridge University Press are just a few of the high-quality curricula that are available to our instructors.</p>
        <p>If you are interested in Business English for your career and other purposes, we would be happy to test your English proficiency and recommend a program tied to the competencies you are developing. We are also glad to talk to corporate HR, or your manager, if that would be of assistance.</p>
