    <h1>Tailored to Your Workplace</h1>
    <p>
        <strong>English Now!</strong> understands the needs of corporate sponsors of English language studies. Better communication can greatly increase your organization’s productivity. After assessing the specific needs of your employees, we design a training workshop using the latest methods to produce quick, practical results.</p>
    <p>We can administer pre- and post-assessments, provide summary progress reports, and administer billing as required. In addition, we can teach onsite at your business location and can focus on areas of relevance in corporate communications such as accent reduction, business vocabulary development and writing.</p>
    <p>
        <strong>English Now!</strong> has working relationships with dozens of embassies, international organizations, and area companies. Here is what some of our clients have said about our corporate programs:</p>
    <blockquote>“The English Now! program has not only enriched our employees personally, but has proven to increase the communication and understanding of these individuals in the workplace. The most visible examples of the benefits are enhanced presentation skills and willingness to present and to articulate work-related issues, a better understanding of policy and processes, and an obvious sense of satisfaction with this newfound clarity and confidence. The cost-to-benefit is clearly outstanding.”</blockquote>
    <p>- Human Resources, GenVec</p>
    <blockquote>“The fact that the classes were tailored to meet our needs was one of the greatest assets of the class. The teacher did an absolutely fantastic job in teaching the classes and creating a very high enthusiasm level in a group of people that aren’t always very enthusiastic. The results of the class were great.”</blockquote>
