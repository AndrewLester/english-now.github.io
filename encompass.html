            <p>We are not a large school, but we take a special approach to language education. ENcompass is our effort to reach out a bit more broadly than ever before. We hope you enjoy these articles. If you are an alumni now back in your home country, you can also "see" some of the school in photos, or you may enjoy a short video of our school (see <a href="http://english-now.com/">here</a>) or of our classes (see <a href=intensive-english-program>here</a>).</p>
            <p>By the way, we call this "ENcompass" because one of the meanings of the word "encompass" is "to include a wide range of ideas." English Now! is a special place because we welcome people from many nations, cultures, and languages. We all grow through the experience.

            <h3>Understanding U.S. Universities and the TOEFL Test</h3>
            <img src="images/encompass/college-map.jpg">
            <p>Some of our students want to study in the United States, at a college or university, and we are frequently asked about admissions requirements and college application processes. In addition, many students ask us about the TOEFL (or other) English language examinations required by American universities.</p>
            <p>We have prepared a resource for students that will help you think about pursuing higher education in the United States. Please feel free to download our <a href="files/Higher-Education-FAQ.doc">U.S. Higher Education FAQ</a> document, which addresses many of the common questions that people ask. For example, what is the difference between a college and a university? What are the TOEFL or other test requirements for undergraduate or graduate programs, in the U.S.?
            </p>
            <p>We are honored to have helped many students prepare for college or university in the United States and wish you well, if you are on this path!</p>

            <h3>Spotlight on a Student: Alessia Garcia</h3>
            <p>Alessia has studied at English Now! for the past two years during her high school summer vacation. She has studied in the Intensive English Program and prepared for the TOEFL exam. In March, 2016 she led two workshops to teach other English Now! students about American Sign Language. She recently spoke with us about her interests and her goals for the future.</p>
            <p><em>Where did you go to high school?</em></p>
            <p>I went to a navy school in Peru called Liceo Naval Almirante Guise. Only children of people in the navy can attend my school.</p>
            <p><em><p><em>What were your favorite activities and subjects in high school?</em></p>
            <p>I am a swimmer in Peru, and I love athletics. I was an actress and a model for a few years, and I love art. I was in a drama club, and I love Spanish language.</p>
            <p><em>What do you plan to study at the university?</em></p>
            <p>I want to study public relations at the Peruvian University of Applied Sciences. Then, I want to come back to the United States to get a masters at Georgetown University. So, it’s one of my options to come here again.</p>
            <p><em>When did you start studying English?</em></p>
            <p>I have had nine hours of English per week since Kindergarten – the alphabet, numbers, basic questions, spelling your name. It’s obligatory to take that class. In high school, I was placed in advanced level English after taking an exam.</p>
            <p><em>How is studying English different here than in Peru?</em></p>
            <p>I prefer to come here because I know that when I touch American ground, I need to switch to English. I think that it’s better for me to study here. When I was in school it was two hours a day and then Spanish classes. When I was in school I wasn’t thinking that English was necessary for my life, but when I came here I really saw that I needed English.</p>
            <p><em>How did you get interested in American Sign Language?</em></p>
            <p>I always wanted to do sign language. I used to say “it would be good if I could". But when I came here I said, “I am going to do it", and I bought the books to learn American Sign Language.</p>
            <p><em>And now you're teaching American Sign Language classes at English Now!</em></p>
            <p>Yes, thank you for the opportunity. When I teach, I know that I need to know everything. I just want to thank you for the opportunity to teach other people about something that I think is important. I think it’s important to know that there are people that can’t do what we do, but God gave them another gift. I think that sign language is like magic because people can communicate with their hands. So, thank you for the opportunity, and for teaching me what I know, because I have learned more here than in Peru!</p>

            <h3>Spotlight on a Teacher: Alison McCaul</h3>
            <img src="images/staff/alison-mccaul.jpg">
            <p>
                <em>How long have you taught at English Now?</em>
            </p>
            <p>I started in 2008 -- just around the time Paul Boesen bought the school.</p>
            <p>
                <em>What is your favorite part of teaching English?</em>
            </p>
            <p>The students, especially watching their relationships develop at English Now. When you bring these multiple cultures into a room together, there is this kind of awkward silence on the first day. And then as they come in each day, they get more and more familiar with each other and they are no longer just studying, but building relationships as well.</p>
            <p>
                <em>What did you do before you began teaching at English Now?</em>
            </p>
            <p>I was starting my family. I was living overseas for my husband’s job: first in Madagascar in 2001 and then we moved directly to India. My husband works for the World Bank as an agriculture economist.</p>
            <p>
                <em>Can you tell us a bit about your experiences with your family first in Madagascar and then in India?</em>
            </p>
            <p>Well, I had three babies back then [in Madagascar]. I went with a 4 month old baby, and then I had my twins while we were living there (they are just one year apart). We traveled a lot in Madagascar. I remember our last trip in Madagascar -- my kids were 3 and 4 years old -- and it was raining and they had on their little rain jackets -- and we walked into this forest with a guide and we could see these huge lemurs just jumping from the trees. It was fantastic! Madagascar was a very special place.</p>
            <p>And then we were in Delhi. We went from a country of 16 million to a city of 16 million. And that’s when I started teaching. My kids went to the American embassy school and I started doing substitute teaching there, some ESL but mostly classroom teaching. And we took loads of trips all over India -- by trains, planes, and automobiles. One of our favorite places was Gujarat. We went to a lion park there, where we saw baby lion cubs being born and my daughter was the first one to see them and she was in the newspaper. The national parks were fabulous.</p>
            <p>
                <em>So how did you first get into teaching English?</em>
            </p>
            <p>After graduating college, I worked for the IMF [International Monetary Fund] as a research analyst in Washington DC. After 8 years, I decided I wanted to experience life outside an office. So I started doing volunteer work as a Montgomery County literacy volunteer and I taught a Chinese lady once a week. And then later I found out about the JET (Japanese English Exchange) Program through the Japanese Ministry of Education.</p>
            <p>I applied and was accepted. I lived 2 years in a village in Emukae, Nagasaki prefecture. My apartment was surrounded by rice paddies. The third year on JET I lived in Nagasaki city. My apartment was on top of the mountain with a fabulous view of the harbor. I have very fond memories of Japan.</p>
            <p>
                <em>Where did you grow up?</em>
            </p>
            <p>I grew up here: McLean, Virginia; and DC. I’ve always been involved in international work, so DC was a logical place to be based after college.</p>
            <p>
                <em>What other countries have you lived in?</em>
            </p>
            <p>In addition to living in Japan, Madagascar and India, as a child I lived in Taiwan.</p>
            <p>
                <em>What countries would you like to go to where you haven’t been?</em>
            </p>
            <p>I would like to go visit places in South America. I’ve been to Colombia, but I haven’t been elsewhere in South America. I particularly want to visit my friend in Argentina. What do you like to do in your free time?</p>
            <p>I like to do yoga, swim, bike, and take long walks my dog. I like traveling with my husband and three teenage kids. We love maps and my kids like to mark all the places they’ve visited.</p>

            <h3>Three Great Things that I Experienced While Hiking and Camping</h3>
            <p>Emiko Araki</p>
            <img src="images/encompass/hike1.jpg">
            <p>In August, 2015, Paul, other students and their families, and I went hiking and camping in Virginia, and this became one of the unforgettable events in my life. I will describe three great things that I experienced in the hiking and camping.</p>
            <p>1. Teamwork</p>
            <p>The mountain where we went hiking was rocky and we had to climb up on the rocks many times that were taller than our height. When I could not climb up by myself, Paul or other strong friends always pulled up my arms. When I was very tired and could not go forward, a friend of mine asked me, "May I bring your backpack?”. When some children were tired and did not want to walk, other children and teens encouraged them. Thanks to this wonderful teamwork, we all could reach the top of the mountain. I could not enjoy this feeling of accomplishment without my great teammates. The sandwiches that I ate at the top of the mountain were the most delicious I have ever eaten.</p>
            <p>2. Warmth of fire</p>
            <p>At night, we enjoyed a campfire. Sitting around it, we enjoyed drinking wine, eating s'mores, and talking. There were no electric lights, so the only thing I could see was the fire. When I was watching it and talking with others, I could really relax after the hard day of hiking. Until this time, I did not know that the fire was so warm and made me stay relaxed.</p>
            <img src="images/encompass/hike2.jpg">
            <p>3. Nature</p>
            <p>I was surprised by Paul and his daughter walking around with their bare feet in the campground. It seemed to feel great, so I should have walked without shoes too. On the night of camping, I saw some fireflies flying. The next morning, we went to a stream in the campground and walked in it. The cold stream cooled my tired foot muscles down, and I felt great! All of these were amazing for me since I cannot have these experiences in my hometown, Tokyo.</p>
            <p>I met some people who I went with the hiking and camping for the first time on the day of hiking. However, after hiking and camping, I felt that I have known them for a long time. I would like to express my deepest gratitude to Paul and others for giving me these wonderful, exciting experiences.</p>
            <p>

            <img src=images/encompass/npr.png>
            <p>Join us for a visit to NPR's offices in Washington DC in late February!</p>
            <p>Media plays a special role in studying languages, and also how we understand the world. We are all consumers of media - print, online, video, etc. Our worldviews are shaped by the media we consume, and our language develops based on media, including whether we consume media in English or other languages!</p>
            <p>Recently, students in our Intensive English Program participated in a Lunchtime Talk about news media and using online news resources for improving English. We prepared a <a href=files/Using%20Media%20in%20Your%20Studies.docx>handout</a>that we would love to share with you. In addition, we enjoy sharing a special media outing with you, in the Washington, D.C., area. On Friday, February 26th at 10:00am, we will be visiting the National Public Radio (NPR). <a href=contact-us>Contact us</a> to ask if there are any spaces available - there is a limit, so contact us soon if you'd like to join this outing!</p>
