            <h3>Places We Recommend for a Day or a Weekend…Charlottesville, Virginia</h3>
            <img src=images/encompass/Charlottesville.png>
            <p>
                <em>Students often ask us about things to do outside of Washington, D.C. We are very happy to share a description of one of our favorite nearby destinations! Please also ask at our reception desk for more information about Charlottesville and Monticello next time you are at the school.</em>
            </p>
            <p>Charlottesville is a small city located approximately two hours from Bethesda. It is best known for its historic sites, such as Thomas Jefferson's home at Monticello, as well as the university he created, the beautiful University of Virginia. Take a walk among the classically Virginian architecture of the university and see a great example of an American “college town.” Nearby, you can also a walking tour of downtown Charlottesville and visit other early-American <a href="http://www.visitcharlottesville.org/visitors/things-to-do/historic-sites/">historic sites</a>.</p>
            <p>Monticello is a great place to learn about early American history, the culture of colonial Virginia and the early republic, and one of America’s most famous Presidents. This is also a great place to learn about the American South, including the tragic story of slavery that eventually led to our Civil War. Jefferson’s home has been beautifully preserved, and guided tours are convenient and accessible. Note: you must purchase tickets to tour Monticello. For more information on Monticello or Jefferson, or to purchase tickets, visit the <a href=http://monticello.org>Monticello website</a>.</p>
            <p>Yet there is more than just history to enjoy here. Charlottesville has developed a rich arts and entertainment scene, especially when it comes to live music. You can hear music in clubs, theaters, and on the street. In addition, many good restaurants line the quaint streets downtown. The Charlottesville Historic Downtown Mall is the place to go. A short walk from the University of Virginia’s campus, the Mall offers many arts, entertainment, and restaurant options. You can even go ice skating at an indoor city ice rink on the Mall, in the winter!</p>
            <p>Beyond the city of Charlottesville, miles and miles of undeveloped rural forest and fields are dotted with quaint pockets of rural life. So take a drive along the scenic and gentle roads that wind over hills and low mountains, opening suddenly on to beautiful views. You may even want to drive part. If you like to get moving outdoors, you can kayak the James or Rivanna Rivers, hike wilderness trails, or bike long trails and quiet country roads where farmers are harvesting crops in fields that have been worked by their families for generations.</p>
            <p>There are also many <a href=http://visitcharlottesville.org/visitors/things-to-do/orchards-and-gardens>orchards</a> along those roads, in the summer you can pick strawberries, cherries, and peaches. In the autumn, there are shiny and juicy apples waiting to be picked. Finally, speaking of fruit, <a href=http://visitcharlottesville.org/visitors/things-to-do/wine-tours>enjoy tours and tastings at more than 20 vineyards</a> along the Monticello Wine Trail, and the area's award-winning small-batch beer breweries that make up the Brew Ridge Trail.</p>
            <p>Please let us know if you are traveling to Charlottesville. We'd love to hear how your trip goes, and if you have recommendations for other students and their families!</p>

            <h3>Three Great Things that I Experienced While Hiking and Camping</h3>
            <p>Emiko Araki</p>
            <img src="images/encompass/hike1.jpg">
            <p>In August, 2015, Paul, other students and their families, and I went hiking and camping in Virginia, and this became one of the unforgettable events in my life. I will describe three great things that I experienced in the hiking and camping.</p>
            <p>1. Teamwork</p>
	        <p>The mountain where we went hiking was rocky and we had to climb up on the rocks many times that were taller than our height. When I could not climb up by myself, Paul or other strong friends always pulled up my arms. When I was very tired and could not go forward, a friend of mine asked me, "May I bring your backpack?”. When some children were tired and did not want to walk, other children and teens encouraged them. Thanks to this wonderful teamwork, we all could reach the top of the mountain. I could not enjoy this feeling of accomplishment without my great teammates. The sandwiches that I ate at the top of the mountain were the most delicious I have ever eaten.</p>
            <p>2. Warmth of fire</p>
            <p>At night, we enjoyed a campfire. Sitting around it, we enjoyed drinking wine, eating s'mores, and talking. There were no electric lights, so the only thing I could see was the fire. When I was watching it and talking with others, I could really relax after the hard day of hiking. Until this time, I did not know that the fire was so warm and made me stay relaxed.</p>
            <img src="images/encompass/hike2.jpg">
            <p>3. Nature</p>
            <p>I was surprised by Paul and his daughter walking around with their bare feet in the campground. It seemed to feel great, so I should have walked without shoes too. On the night of camping, I saw some fireflies flying. The next morning, we went to a stream in the campground and walked in it. The cold stream cooled my tired foot muscles down, and I felt great!  All of these were amazing for me since I cannot have these experiences in my hometown, Tokyo.</p>
            <p>I met some people who I went with the hiking and camping for the first time on the day of hiking. However, after hiking and camping, I felt that I have known them for a long time. I would like to express my deepest gratitude to Paul and others for giving me these wonderful, exciting experiences.</p>
            <p><em>Emiko Araki has been a student at English Now! since November, 2014. In Japan, she was a patent engineer in chemistry and molecular biology fields at Shiga International Patent Office, and instructor at Tokyo College of Biotechnology. Currently, Emiko studies molecular biology at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). In her spare time, Emiko enjoys running and spending time with her husband and cat, Mi.</em></p>

            <h3>Spotlight on a Teacher</h3>
            <img src=images/encompass/dog.jpg>
            <p>
                <strong>Interview with English Now! Teacher, Marian DeAngelo</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>You have been a dedicated teacher with English Now! for four years. What is your favorite part of being a teacher?</em>
            </p>
            <p>I enjoy having the opportunity to meet people from various parts of the word and learn about cultures and interact with them to find out how similar everyone really is in so many ways. Being a teacher here is unique. English Now! provides the opportunity to be creative and open sand small classes give you an intimate relationship with students. That’s way I love about being here. The students are here because they want to be here. It’s fun to work with enthusiastic and motivated students.</p>
            <p>
                <em>How did you decide that you wanted to be a teacher?</em>
            </p>
            <p>Some of my past summer jobs were at camps – teaching nature – I always a love for teaching. I got laid off from a corporate job. I started subbing. If I could handle being a substitute, then I knew I could do it. I survived the substitute world and when I moved to San Diego I went back to school for my teaching certificate. I taught fifth grade and I I had to plan my lessons so that my Spanish-speaking students could understand. Part of my training was teaching ESL and I had to learn how to reach students whose first language wasn’t English.</p>
            <p>
                <em>What was it like teaching in Germany?</em>
            </p>
            <p>In Germany I taught adults and I LOVED it. It was in a business setting and the students came to me because they wanted to learn English. Students were so personable and I became friends with many of them. As the years progressed, I also started teaching German kids in a neighborhood school who really wanted to improve their English. I had a great experience with those young students, some of whom have visited me in the U.S.. I would definitely go back to Germany again - I loved it so much.</p>
            <p>
                <em>You are an avid traveler. What is your favorite destination in the United States?</em>
            </p>
            <p>It’s hard to pinpoint because there are so many fantastic, beautiful places in the U.S. My favorite vacations have been to Alaska and to Bryce and Zion in Utah. My two favorites states are Oregon and Vermont.</p>
            <p>
                <em>In addition to teaching people, you also teach dogs! How did you get started in that work?</em>
            </p>
            <p>My interest in language relates to my work with my dogs – it’s all about making an association between a word and an action. For example, sometimes I use English and sometimes I use German, when I want them to do a backwards circle on the left, I use the German word for back, “hinter”, and I want them to go on the right side I use English and say “backwards circle”.</p>
            <p>After getting our dogs, Mario and Bella, we thought – let’s really work with these dogs and train them to have good manners. So, I started focusing on obedience. Then I was working with a trainer who recognized that Mario and Bella had special abilities. She suggested that I work with another trainer who taught tricks. The trainer’s program was called Mutts Gone Nuts. From then on I was hooked. After a year of training with Mutts Gone Nuts, I was asked to join him for shows. After a year of that, I decided to start contacting senior centers to do shows for the elderly.</p>
            <p>
                <em>How can we meet your dogs, Mario and Bella?</em>
            </p>
            <p>If you’re interested in seeing Mario and Bella perform, there’s an upcoming show – The Leesburg Animal Park on Sunday, October 4 at 1:00 p.m. The show is called Jacks and Jokers.</p>

            <h3>More Things to Do in the Fall…Maryland Farms & Farm Festivals</h3>
            <p>
                <em>This is a great activity for international residents of the U.S. or visitors, in the fall!</em>
            </p>
            <p>Visiting a farm is a wonderful autumn tradition in the U.S. If you want to drive further, Virginia has delightful farm festivals in the beautiful foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. But there are plenty of good ones right here in Maryland. Pick apples and pumpkins, drink cider, slide down a hill on a sack, get lost in a “corn maze”, and enjoy the crisp autumn air!</p>
            <h4>Homestead Farm</h4>
            <p>Where: 15604 Sugarland Road, Poolesville, Maryland 20837 (19 miles)</p>
            <p>When: Until October 31, open seven days per week, “pick-your-own” 9am-5pm, market 9am-6pm</p>
            <p>Admission: No admission, pay for fruit you pick or buy at the market</p>
            <p>The closest farm to Bethesda, this is a great destination for apple picking or – in October – to find a pumpkin for Halloween. This is a family-owned farm offering pick-your-own fruits, berries, vegetables, but note that it does not have activities, rides, or festivals like some of the others listed.</p>
            <h4>Montpelier Farms</h4>
            <p>Where: 1720 Crain Highway North, Upper Marlboro, Maryland 20774 (32 miles)</p>
            <p>When: Sept 7 – Nov 3, Fridays 5-11pm, Saturdays 10am – 11pm, Sundays 11am – 7pm</p>
            <p>Admission: $10/ages 13 and up, $8/ages 3-12, free for 2 and under</p>
            <p>This farm features a “Fall Festival” from September 5 through November 1. Try to find your way in a corn field! They have pumpkins, hayrides, animals, hill slides, camp fires, and more---and perhaps the BEST corn maze of all the fall farm festivals!</p>
            <h4>Clark’s Elioak Farm</h4>
            <p>Where: 10500 Clarksville Pike, Ellicott City, Maryland 21042 (28 miles)</p>
            <p>When: Ongoing; Pumpkin patch open Sept 21 – Nov 3, 10am – 5pm daily</p>
            <p>Admission: $5, babies 1 and under are free</p>
            <p>This farm feels like a fairytale. The large grounds offer pumpkins, cider, Halloween fun, and fairytale fun. There are hayrides, cow train rides, slides, farm animals to pet, a pumpkin patch, a pine tree maze, and more. On weekends, you can also enjoy special activities like pumpkin coloring and crafts, a teddy bear visit, a reptile show, face painting, and gem mining.</p>
            <h4>Butler’s Orchards</h4>
            <p>Where: 22200 Davis Mill Road, Germantown, Maryland 20876 (22 miles)</p>
            <p>When: Saturdays & Sundays Sept 28 – Oct 26, 10am – 5pm</p>
            <p>Admission: $10, free for children 2 and under</p>
            <p>Jump in the hayloft, take hayrides, go down the tube slide, join a rubber ducky derby, pet animals, ride a pony, pick pumpkins, walk a corn maze, have your face painted, and more. Note that some activities and food costs extra. But you are free to bring along your own picnic from home.</p>
            <h4>We hope you enjoy your trip to the countryside, if you are able to enjoy one of these destinations this fall!</h4>

            <h3>Spotlight on Creative Writing</h3>
            <p>Creative Writing as an afternoon workshop for advanced students in the Intensive English Program at English Now! We were so excited to read the work completed over the summer by some visiting students, and we would like to share it with you:</p>
            <br>
            <p>Outside, near the trees and green, I feel relaxing and quiet. The sounds of the wind move sweetly the trees, which make a soft sound. All the birds probably are inside comfortable and little houses in the wood and trees. So they feel protected and they don’t sing, especially today that is a cloudy and gray day. All around me is especially green and some water cover some part of the ground because the day before the rain fell like pouring rain. The houses near the trees are empty and no people are talking or shouting, just silence and a natural sounds covers this area. You can hear the far noises of the cars on the street and also the works on the road probably men are building something new. However, they aren’t so close, and it is easy and simple to be interested in natural elements and focused on the quiet movement of the trees and of the wind.</p>
            <img src="images/encompass/Elisabetta.jpg" alt="Elisabetta, a student from the Creative Writing class">
            <p>By: Elisabetta from Italy</p>
            <br>
            <p>When the winds come leaves are waving.</p>
            <p>In the air is the smell of rain.</p>
            <p>Will it rain soon?</p>

            <h4>The Top Hat Found</h4>
            <p>There was a horrible animal that could live on the water but also on the land. All humans were terrified by it, because it was really angry. He preferred to live in the water in particular in a lake near a small city called Macera. The habitants of this city never went to the lake, but one day one wayfarer arrived. The other people said to him that a terrible creature lived in the waters of the lake. The only problem was that the man was very interested to see this strange animal, so he decided to go to the lake.</p>
            <p>When he arrived there at the start he didn’t see anything in the water. That was because the creature was behind him. So the man was coming home when something bit his leg and he saw the horrible animal. After that day nobody found this man but only his top hat.</p>

            <p>Here’s what their teacher, Liz Paul, says about her approach to Creative Writing:</p>
            <p>We are always writing something new in the Creative Writing class. The focus of the class is generating rather than perfecting writing. At English Now! we know the importance of things like grammar, punctuation, and word choice, but in the Creative Writing class, I try to create a space where we don’t worry about these things. I want students in the class to write freely and bravely about things that matter to them. For most of us in our daily lives, writing is something we do to communicate with a particular audience to achieve a particular goal. In Creative Writing, we write for ourselves, for the pleasure and adventure of it. My favorite part of the class is when the writers share their work with each other—it’s such a gift! It also helps us learn more about each other and our cultures. So I try to create a space where writers feel free to share, knowing that everyone is listening to appreciate—not judge—each other’s writing. In addition to writing and sharing our own work, we also read poems, stories, and essays by published writers. These examples help us think about the artistic and expressive qualities of English and usually give us new vocabulary too. I hope students in my class have fun, gain confidence as writers, and learn more about what language and literature mean to them.</p>

            <h3>Spotlight on an Instructor: Peggy Blair</h3>
            <p>Margaret Whitman Blair (“Peggy”) is a fantastic instructor, with a special love of teaching writing. She's even a published author! Meet Peggy below!</p>
            <p>
                <em>How did you decide that you wanted to be a teacher?</em>
            </p>
            <p>I guess it all started with my own teachers when I was young, several of who insisted that I should be a teacher. One was so sure of this that she invited me to teach The Great Gatsby to our class! I did enjoy that, but still, I wasn’t so sure. In my young mind, being a teacher sounded a bit boring, actually. Well, I think I can now admit that those teachers were right---I enjoy teaching so much!</p>
            <p>My first real teaching position was in Osaka, Japan. I had studied Japanese (and French) at university, and had been an exchange student in Japan, so I was very happy to find a way to return there after I graduated. It was a wonderful experience, although this was in 1973-74, the time of the energy crisis, so I do remember that the winter was extremely cold!</p>
            <p>I taught in DC for a while after that, but my next big teaching job was with the Peace Corps. I lived and taught in a teacher’s training college, a few hours from Bangkok, Thailand for a little over two years. I also met my husband there!</p>
            <p>During the Peace Corps, I did a lot of traveling in Southeast Asia and after that I worked on a kibbutz in Israel sorting apples, and backpacked around the Greek Islands and traveled through Europe. I then went back to school to earn a Master’s degree in International Relations, and spent many years as a journalist covering international trade issues. I loved that—the writing, the press conferences, the deadlines, and the whole field. I needed to scale back on that work when I had my first child (Matt, now 29), and left it entirely some time after our second (David, now 26) arrived. That’s when I turned to fiction writing.</p>
            <p>
                <em>How exactly did you become a writer?</em>
            </p>
            <p>I started writing screenplays with a partner, when I had young children, which was fun, but never really took off. My first book idea actually came from my eldest son, Matthew. He was 8 or 9 at the time, and was very interested in the Civil War. So we read book after book, watched movies, and went to Civil War “re-enactments.” Because my two boys used to fight quite a bit, I was inspired to write about two present day brothers who argued a lot and while in a Civil War re-enactment, went back in time, finding themselves on opposite sides in the Civil War. My son Matt was my first reader and editor!</p>
            <p>
                <em>How did you get the ideas for your other five books?</em>
            </p>
            <p>After the first historical fiction novel, they followed fairly naturally. It helped that I was an interviewer on a cable TV show at that time, called “Out of the Past,” which allowed me to talk with historians and others knowledgeable about different eras and events in history. So I got new ideas that way, and was also able to do a lot of my research through the show once I had the idea, too. For example, I interviewed a woman who was one of the early female pilots around the time of the 1929 “Powder Puff Derby,” which later became fodder for my book called The Roaring Twenty: The First Cross-Country Air Race for Women.</p>
            <p>
                <em>How did you come to teach at English Now!?</em>
            </p>
            <p>After my boys grew up, I felt a little isolated, though I was a member of many writers’ groups, and I taught at the Writer’s Center in Bethesda (courses on writing historical novels). I heard about English Now! in 2008 and I knew that I wanted to go back to my first love, teaching, and I have been happily teaching here ever since.</p>
            <p>
                <em>What is your favorite part of being a teacher?</em>
            </p>
            <p>It’s hard to pick one favorite, as there are so many nice moments, but if I had to choose, I would say that my favorite experience is when a student is able to communicate at a deeper level, and share his or her feelings, or an experience with me. When a student explains or describes something in a way that I can immediately understand, in a way that communicates their personality, especially when previously they couldn’t really express themselves well---I am thrilled! And I do love to share a good laugh with a student. That makes my day!</p>
            <p>
                <em>What is different about English Now! compared to other places that you have taught?</em>
            </p>
            <p>There is a wonderful energy at English Now!, I find. Also, the teachers here are given the opportunity to be themselves. We are given the freedom to teach in the way that we think is best, to really look at each student, and tailor-make a program for that individual student’s needs. I have taught at places like Berlitz, and it is not such a fun experience, because you have to use only the Berlitz method, and only the Berlitz books. That can be very stifling. I think the English Now! way is much more effective for our students, as is the smaller class size at English Now!.</p>
            <p>
                <em>What are your hobbies, besides writing?</em>
                <p>Well, I can really sympathize with my students at English Now! because I am currently studying Spanish, and it sure isn’t easy! But I do enjoy learning new languages, and I also enjoy bicycling and doing crossword puzzles.</p>
                <p>
                    <em>What book are you working on now?</em>
                </p>
                <p>I am working on a mystery novel set in 1882 Siam (Thailand). It does require a lot of research, though, and the plot is complicated, so it is going very slowly. Plus, I just had my hip replaced, which has also slowed me down a bit!</p>
                <p>
                    <em>What is your favorite place to visit in the United States?</em>
                </p>
                <p>Oh, it is so hard to choose! There are many: I love the Southwest, southeastern Utah, Santa Fe, and also the Pacific Northwest. Here on the East Coast, I like Block Island (RI) and the Florida Keys.</p>
                <p>
                    <em>What else would you want your students to know about you?</em>
                </p>
                <p>That I love my sons, and I miss them very much! Matthew is in Providence RI, working as a lawyer for people with disabilities. And David is involved in the opening of a high-end “small plate”/tapas restaurant in Madison, WI. I do have 2 cats, whom I also love, but they can’t fill the boys’ shoes!</p>
                <p>My husband Bob is an economist, working on antitrust issues with the Federal Maritime Commission. He also teaches poetry writing on Wednesday mornings, at Miriam’s Kitchen (which serves homeless people). He has even had a poem published, in fact, so there are now two writers in the family! We have been happily married for 37 years.</p>
                <p>I think that’s all I’d like to add!</p>

            <p>Media plays a special role in studying languages, and also how we understand the world. We are all consumers of media - print, online, video, etc. Our worldviews are shaped by the media we consume, and our language develops based on media, including whether we consume media in English or other languages!</p>
            <p>Recently, students in our Intensive English Program participated in a Lunchtime Talk about news media and using online news resources for improving English. We prepared a <a href=files/Using%20Media%20in%20Your%20Studies.docx>handout</a>that we would love to share with you. In addition, we enjoy sharing a special media outing with you, in the Washington, D.C., area. On Friday, June 5th at 10:00am, we will be visiting the National Public Radio (NPR). <a href=contact-us>Contact us</a> to ask if there are any spaces available - there is a limit, so contact us soon if you'd like to join this outing!</p>

            <h3>Weekly &quot;Parent Talk&quot; Conversation Club</h3>
            <img src=images/Parent-Talk-1.jpg>
            <p>English Now! loves serving families. It is an honor for us to meet visiting family members, and especially to be able to work with children of our students. Most of our classes are for adults, but we tried a new approach to a mother and child class this spring. Our "Parent Talk" conversation club is a fun opportunity for mothers to practice their English and for babies and toddlers to play with toys and each other, and we added structured conversation about about parenting and child development this spring. English Now! is talking about some of the most important topics in life, for all of us!</p>
            <p>Each week we look at a different parenting topic, such as sleep, feeding, childbirth, the role of fathers, and discipline. We talk about cultural differences, the students ask each others opinions, and we laugh a lot! Not only do we learn that there are many ways to parent well, but we also get practical ideas from each other, and comfort from knowing that others have questions about parenting, too.</p>Our most interesting conversations have been about the advice that we would each give to a soon-to-be mother. The answers varied, as do our cultures and experiences! Some said, "Don't compare your child to other children." Others said, "Don't compare yourself to other moms." "Seek to enjoy your children more than to control them," was another piece of advice, as was, "Actions speak louder than words!" What was the most common advice? "Be consistent!"
            <p>Of course, we also learn some practical and helpful parenting vocabulary, idioms, and phrasal verbs, such as:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Watching children grow up so fast is bittersweet.</li>
                <li>How did you sleep last night? Oh, I slept like a baby!</li>
                <li>Who sleeps in on Saturday, you or your husband?</li>
                <li>If babies have their needs met quickly, they will feel secure. They will learn that the world is good and people can be trusted.</li>
                <li>My daughter's favorite stalling methods include asking for water and asking questions.</li>
                <li>Oh, your daughter is so precious!</li>
                <li>We all hope our children will get along with others well.</li>
                <li>The toddler got away with climbing up on the table.</li>
                <li>The child often wants to be picked up.</li>
                <li>She puts her son down for a nap at 1PM.</li>
                <li>My toddler never eats vegetables. He is so stubborn! He just will not give in and even try them!</li>
                <li>Her mother waits in the room until the baby drops off to sleep.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Our Parent Talk Conversation Club meets on Monday afternoons and Wednesday mornings. Contact us to ask about the time, and if we are meeting (we sometimes take time off in the summer, like our international friends!).</p>
