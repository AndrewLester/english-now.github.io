            <h3>Our Suggestions: Great Things to Do with Visitors in D.C. This Summer! Art, Athletics, Adventure and More!</h3>
            <img src="images/encompass/IMAG0264.jpg">
            <p>Maybe you have heard that Washington can be very HOT in the summer, but has anyone ever told you how many COOL things there to do in and around the nation’s capital? We’ve put together a list of a few hidden gems that we think you, your friends and family will enjoy.</p>
            <h4>Public Pools:</h4>
            <p>You will hear about people "going to the pool" starting soon after Memorial Day. Swimming is very popular with residents and visitors of all ages, and public pools in the United States are often very high quality. Many families spend much of the day at the pool. Children play with their friends, and families often order pizza and eat dinner outside in the evenings. Also, "swim teams", competitive swim groups for children, are a great and inexpensive way for international children to learn to swim well and to spend time with kids their age. There are seven outdoor pools that are open to the public in Montgomery County, Maryland, just outside Washington, D.C. Find out where the nearest public pool is located by visiting the <a href="http://montgomerycountymd.gov/rec/thingstodo/aquatics/outdoor.html">Montgomery County Aquatics website</a>.</p>
            <h4>Extended Hours at Smithsonian Museums:</h4>
            <p>Most Washington D.C. museums are free and fantastic! During the Spring and Summer, enjoy extended hours at the National Museum of American History, National Air and Space Museum, National Museum of Natural History and The National Zoo! Because they are free, you don’t have to spend your whole day at the museum. You can go for an hour or two and then come back another day. Join us on our Friday outings or plan your own trips to the<a href="http://si.edu">Smithsonian</a>.</p>
            <h4>Indoor Ice-Skating:</h4>
            <p>This may be surprising to you. You may not think about ice skating in the summer. But ice skating is not just for wintertime in Washington, D.C. It can be a great break from the heat, in the summer! Several area ice skating rinks are open year-round (winter, spring, summer and fall). Visit their web sites to find out about public skating hours and skate rental prices:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="http://montgomeryparks.org/enterprise/ice/cabin_john/index.shtm">Cabin John Ice Rink</a> - 10610 Westlake Drive, Rockville, Maryland. (301) 365-2246</li>
                <li><a href="http://dc.about.com/od/marylandparks/a/WheatonRegional.htm">Wheaton Ice Rink</a> - 11751 Orebaugh, Wheaton, Maryland. (301) 649-3640</li>
                <li><a href="http://%20http//rockvilleice.pointstreaksites.com/view/rockvilleice">Rockville Ice Arena</a> - 50 Southlawn Court, Rockville, Maryland. (301) 294-8101</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Biking:</h4>
            <p>Biking is a great way to see things in the Washington, D.C. area. We are blessed with clean air and safe bike paths that allow us to travel easily around the area, often without having to travel far on major streets. Did you know that you can bike from Bethesda, Maryland to historic Georgetown in Washington, D.C., in about 30 minutes? Take the "Capital Crescent Bike Trail." This "bike trail" used to be a train track, but it has now been converted into a nicely-paved bike path. Follow the Capital Crescent Trail from downtown Bethesda, only 0.2 miles from English Now!, across the street from Barnes &amp; Noble, and ride until the trail ends in Georgetown. Once you're there, enjoy lunch next to the Potomac River for a great outing for you and friends or family.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>For information about the Capital Crescent Trail, including a map, click <a href="http://cctrail.org">here</a>.</li>
                <li>For information about bike rentals in Bethesda, click <a href="http://www.bigwheelbikes.com/">here</a>.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Boating and/or an Outdoor Picnic:</h4>
            <p>You may be surprised to know that you can rent a rowboat or a kayak and see the Washington from the water! Every fall we travel with students and friends by bike into D.C. for an outdoor picnic and kayaking on the Potomac. This is a great outing, and if you'd like you can even go fishing in the Potomac River or the C&amp;O Canal.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="http://fletcherscove.com">Fletcher's Boat House</a> is located along the Capital Crescent Trail at 4940 Canal Road, NW, Washington, DC (202) 244-0461</li>
                <li><a href="http://boatingindc.com/key-bridge-boathouse">Key Bridge Boat House</a> is located along the Capital Crescent Trail at the eight mile marker at 3500 Water St. NW, Washington, DC (202) 337-9642</li>
                <li><a href="http://thompsonboatcenter.com">Thompson Boat House</a> is located at the end of the Capital Crescent Trail in Georgetown at 2900 Virginia Ave NW, Washington, DC, (202) 333-9543</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Free Summer Concerts:</h4>
            <p>Throughout the summer, there are many outdoor music concerts in the D.C. area, and many of them are free of charge including concerts on the Washington Mall. Check out this web site to get some ideas about <a href="http://dc.abouyt.com/od/concerts/a/summerconcerts.htm">summer concerts</a>.</p>
            <p>Get ready for a great summer! With Best Wishes from English Now!</p>

            <h3>Weekly &quot;Parent Talk&quot; Conversation Club</h3>
            <img src="images/Parent-Talk-1.jpg">
            <p>English Now! loves serving families. It is an honor for us to meet visiting family members, and especially to be able to work with children of our students. Most of our classes are for adults, but we tried a new approach to a mother and child class this spring. Our "Parent Talk" conversation club is a fun opportunity for mothers to practice their English and for babies and toddlers to play with toys and each other, and we added structured conversation about about parenting and child development this spring. English Now! is talking about some of the most important topics in life, for all of us!</p>
            <p>Each week we look at a different parenting topic, such as sleep, feeding, childbirth, the role of fathers, and discipline. We talk about cultural differences, the students ask each others opinions, and we laugh a lot! Not only do we learn that there are many ways to parent well, but we also get practical ideas from each other, and comfort from knowing that others have questions about parenting, too.</p>
            Our most interesting conversations have been about the advice that we would each give to a soon-to-be mother. The answers varied, as do our cultures and experiences! Some said, "Don't compare your child to other children." Others said, "Don't compare yourself to other moms." "Seek to enjoy your children more than to control them," was another piece of advice, as was, "Actions speak louder than words!" What was the most common advice? "Be consistent!"</p>
            <p>Of course, we also learn some practical and helpful parenting vocabulary, idioms, and phrasal verbs, such as:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Watching children grow up so fast is bittersweet.</li>
                <li>How did you sleep last night? Oh, I slept like a baby!</li>
                <li>Who sleeps in on Saturday, you or your husband?</li>
                <li>If babies have their needs met quickly, they will feel secure. They will learn that the world is good and people can be trusted.</li>
                <li>My daughter's favorite stalling methods include asking for water and asking questions.</li>
                <li>Oh, your daughter is so precious!</li>
                <li>We all hope our children will get along with others well.</li>
                <li>The toddler got away with climbing up on the table.</li>
                <li>The child often wants to be picked up.</li>
                <li>She puts her son down for a nap at 1PM.</li>
                <li>My toddler never eats vegetables. He is so stubborn! He just will not give in and even try them!</li>
                <li>Her mother waits in the room until the baby drops off to sleep.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Our Parent Talk Conversation Club meets on Friday mornings and will meet twice-weekly from the fall. Contact us to ask about the time, and if we are meeting (we sometimes take time off in the summer, like our international friends!).</p>

            <h3>Spotlight on a Student</h3>
            <p>Recently, students in Linda La Pierre's Conversation Plus class were asked to write about their "most memorable lie" form childhood. One student, Sophie from France, shared this story with the class, and we loved it so much that we asked her if we could also publish it in ENcompass. Enjoy!</p>
            <p>"Frankly, I don’t remember telling a big lie when I was a child. I have just an anecdote: I was learning to read and write, and I was fascinated by the number “2”. It’s a nice design, with a curve and a straight line. I drew it everywhere.</p>
            <p>One day, I was in my grandparents’ bedroom – a lovely bedroom with champagne-colored wallpaper, with very fine velvet stripes. I saw on the bedside table a beautiful red marker. It was there apparently to train to write a nice “2” in red on the champagne-colored wall!</p>
            <p>My grandfather asked me, “What’s that?” I guessed that the answer “a beautiful ‘2’ “ was not the right answer. So, I improvised an explanation:</p>
            <p>“I was drawing a “2” on a piece of paper when my brother arrived. I put the paper on the wall so he wouldn’t see it, and the red ink rubbed off on the wall.”</p>
            <p>The problem was that “at the reconstruction of the events,” the ink never rubbed off!</p>
            <p>Strangely, I don't remember a punishment."</p>

            <h3>Spotlight on a Teacher</h3>
            <img src="images/encompass/dog.jpg">
            <p><strong>Interview with English Now! Teacher, Marian DeAngelo</strong></p>
            <p><em>You have been a dedicated teacher with English Now! for four years. What is your favorite part of being a teacher?</em></p>
            <p>I enjoy having the opportunity to meet people from various parts of the word and learn about cultures and interact with them to find out how similar everyone really is in so many ways. Being a teacher here is unique. English Now! provides the opportunity to be creative and open sand small classes give you an intimate relationship with students. That’s way I love about being here. The students are here because they want to be here. It’s fun to work with enthusiastic and motivated students.</p>
            <p><em>How did you decide that you wanted to be a teacher?</em></p>
            <p>Some of my past summer jobs were at camps – teaching nature – I always a love for teaching. I got laid off from a corporate job. I started subbing. If I could handle being a substitute, then I knew I could do it. I survived the substitute world and when I moved to San Diego I went back to school for my teaching certificate. I taught fifth grade and I I had to plan my lessons so that my Spanish-speaking students could understand. Part of my training was teaching ESL and I had to learn how to reach students whose first language wasn’t English.</p>
            <p><em>What was it like teaching in Germany?</em></p>
            <p>In Germany I taught adults and I LOVED it. It was in a business setting and the students came to me because they wanted to learn English. Students were so personable and I became friends with many of them. As the years progressed, I also started teaching German kids in a neighborhood school who really wanted to improve their English. I had a great experience with those young students, some of whom have visited me in the U.S.. I would definitely go back to Germany again - I loved it so much.</p>
            <p><em>You are an avid traveler. What is your favorite destination in the United States?</em></p>
            <p>It’s hard to pinpoint because there are so many fantastic, beautiful places in the U.S. My favorite vacations have been to Alaska and to Bryce and Zion in Utah. My two favorites states are Oregon and Vermont.</p>
            <p><em>In addition to teaching people, you also teach dogs! How did you get started in that work?</em></p>
            <p>My interest in language relates to my work with my dogs – it’s all about making an association between a word and an action. For example, sometimes I use English and sometimes I use German, when I want them to do a backwards circle on the left, I use the German word for back, “hinter”, and I want them to go on the right side I use English and say “backwards circle”.</p>
            <p>After getting our dogs, Mario and Bella, we thought – let’s really work with these dogs and train them to have good manners. So, I started focusing on obedience. Then I was working with a trainer who recognized that Mario and Bella had special abilities. She suggested that I work with another trainer who taught tricks. The trainer’s program was called Mutts Gone Nuts. From then on I was hooked. After a year of training with Mutts Gone Nuts, I was asked to join him for shows. After a year of that, I decided to start contacting senior centers to do shows for the elderly.</p>
            <p><em>How can we meet your dogs, Mario and Bella?</em></p>
            <p>If you’re interested in seeing Mario and Bella perform, there’s an upcoming show – The Leesburg Animal Park on Sunday, October 4 at 1:00 p.m. The show is called Jacks and Jokers.</p>

            <h3>Visit to National Public Radio (NPR)</h3>
            <img src="images/encompass/npr.png">
            <p>Media plays a special role in studying languages, and also how we understand the world. We are all consumers of media - print, online, video, etc. Our worldviews are shaped by the media we consume, and our language develops based on media, including whether we consume media in English or other languages!</p>
            <p>Recently, students in our Intensive English Program participated in a Lunchtime Talk about news media and using online news resources for improving English. We prepared a <a href="files/Using%20Media%20in%20Your%20Studies.docx">handout</a>that we would love to share with you. In addition, we enjoy sharing a special media outing with you, in the Washington, D.C., area. On Friday, June 5th at 10:00am, we will be visiting the National Public Radio (NPR). <a href="contact-us">Contact us</a> to ask if there are any spaces available - there is a limit, so contact us soon if you'd like to join this outing!</p>

            <h3>Understanding U.S. Universities and the TOEFL Test</h3>
            <img src="images/encompass/college-map.jpg">
            <p>Some of our students want to study in the United States, at a college or university, and we are frequently asked about admissions
            requirements and college application processes. In addition, many students ask us about the TOEFL (or other) English language
            examinations required by American universities.</p>
            <p>We have prepared a resource for students that will help you think about pursuing higher education in the United States. Please feel
            free to download our <a href="files/English%20Now-%20-%20Higher%20Education%20FAQ.pdf">U.S. Higher Education FAQ</a> document, which addresses many of the common questions that people ask. For example, what is the difference between a college and a university? What are the TOEFL or other test requirements for undergraduate or graduate programs, in the U.S.?</p>
            <p>We are honored to have helped many students prepare for college or university in the United States and wish you well, if you are on
            this path!</p>
