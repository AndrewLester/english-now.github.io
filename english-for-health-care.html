        <strong>English for Health Care Curriculum</strong>
    </p>
    <p>The needs of students pursuing careers in health care or public health are varied. Students may have to complete NCLEX or TOEFL requirements, or medical boards, to practice in the United States, or they may be thinking about presenting the results of their research to their peers, in English. We have been delighted to work with a wide range of medical/health care practitioners from around the world, and it brings us great joy to know that their improved communication skills may enable them to serve others more effectively.</p>
    <p>Whatever your area of interest, ask us about a curriculum and approach to lessons that has the greatest impact on your use of English language. We will help you select a curriculum that is targeted to your needs, and we can also help you with general English classes that improve your comprehension, accurate use of grammar, and pronunciation â€“ even extending beyond your English studies for your profession.</p>
    <p>If you are interested in English for Health Care programs, we would be happy to test your English proficiency and recommend a program tied to the competencies you are developing. We are also glad to talk to administrators in a lab or hospital setting, if that would be of assistance.</p>
