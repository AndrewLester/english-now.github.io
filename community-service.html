    <h1>Community Service & Volunteering: Engage Your Community with English Now!</h1>
    <h4>Engaging in the Community as a Volunteer</h4>
    <p>We encourage you to try volunteering as part of your experience in the United States, to help you engage and serve your American community in a new way. Community service in the United States includes different types of volunteer activities. From assisting the elderly to providing food for the homeless, there are many ways to volunteer through non-profit organizations, schools, museums, and religious organizations. Volunteers help others by giving their time to support issues that they care about. Volunteering can be an opportunity to work on a diverse team, with shared goals.</p>
    <p>We invite you to consider volunteering at a one-time event, once a week, or once a month. Volunteering can offer you a chance to speak English outside the classroom. Throughout the year, English Now! organizes volunteer projects with local organizations to support students as they engage in rewarding, fun activities out in the community.</p>
    <p>As a service to the Washington D.C.-area international community as well as our students and their families, we work with Community Service Partners to organize group volunteering activities. Consider starting your community service experience by participating in a Community Service Week group activity.</p>
    <h4>Community Service Weeks at English Now!</h4>
    <p>We offer many options to volunteer and help other people during Community Service Weeks in the spring and fall each year. See opportunities listed below.
