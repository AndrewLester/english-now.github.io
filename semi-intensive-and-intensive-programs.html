            <p>English Now!’s Intensive English Program is for students who want to improve their English proficiency quickly. Our classes are very small - six students maximum - and very interactive, so you use the English you are studying. Watch a short video of two of our Intensive English Program classes:</p>
            <p>Our Intensive English Program meets Monday through Thursday from 9:30 am until 2:00 pm. During class, your teacher will explore all dimensions of language learning – speaking, listening, reading, and writing. Grammar topics are addressed, there is emphasis on expansion of active vocabulary, and conversation skills are developed. For a full course description of the program, click <a href="files/coursedescription-intensive.pdf">here</a>.</p>
            <p>On Fridays, students may participate in optional group activities, visiting Washington, DC-area museums, monuments, and cultural destinations, in groups led by one of our instructors.</p>
            <p>The maximum number of students per class is six. These are the smallest group class sizes in the Washington, DC area. This ensures that each student receives significant attention. Students at the high beginner level or above may enroll in the Intensive English Program and will be assigned an instructor and a student group at the appropriate level of language proficiency. Placement is based upon a placement test that is conducted at the school (at no charge).</p>
