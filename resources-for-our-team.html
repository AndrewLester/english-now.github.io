    <h1>Resources for Our Team</h1>
    <img src="/images/Camille Flammarion - The Atmosphere.jpg">
    <p>Welcome to English Now!'s new online resource page. This page —; and online resources generally —; are a priority for development, as we move online more quickly than we could have imagined.</p>
    <p>This page includes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Links to Zoom Webinars</li>
        <li>Links to recommended training resources</li>
        <li>Links to recommended online curriculum resources</li>
        <li>Selected information about school operations</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Please bookmark this page. Please also send any suggestions about additional resources to make available here by email to <a href="mailto:info@english-now.com">info@english-now.com</a>, with the subject line, <q>Resources for Our Team.</q> This page will be updated at least weekly. You will be informed —; in Paperless Post invitations that are circulating regularly regarding training activities —; when a significant update has taken place. <u>And please see an important note about <q>office hours & tech support</q> below</u>.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>Well-Being</h4>
    <p>The first and highest priority for all of us during the coronavirus crisis is the physical health and well-being of ourselves and our loved ones. Please take advantage of the following efforts to attend the well-being of the community.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>First, consider joining a <u>small group discussion led by Jane Turner</u> on Wednesdays, Spirit Chat with Friends. Jane’s hope for these conversations is that we inform, support and inspire each other, allowing each participant adequate time (up to three to five minutes) per sharing opportunity, without interruption. This group is intended to be a place to get together personally – not as a place to talk about work (though that may come up) – and as such the group will honor the privacy of participants. And if this group grows too large, as appears to be happening, we’ll add more of these groups. Email <a href="mailto:info@english-now.com">info@english-now.com</a> if you’d like to join Jane’s or another group like this.</li>
        <li>Next, a great resource is available to our team in the form of an online class called “The Science of Well-Being.” This is a class developed by Yale University Professor Laurie Santos, delivered on the online platform Coursera. This is a fantastic class and was even a subject of a BBC article, <q><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-52055242">A college course (the) world wants to study right now</a>.</q> Over 2.4 million people are enrolled in the class worldwide (!) as of May 15. For more information on this class, see <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/the-science-of-well-being">here</a> and watch for a Paperless Post invitation to Zoom Webinars that introduce how the Coursera platform work, introduce this class, and invite discussion about how this and other Coursera classes may be meaningful to our school community.</li>
        <li>Finally – to be very direct – there is no question that the technology we’re all engaging at these times is a major source of stress. And we’re denied the very human, side-by-side interaction, that reassures us all, as one clicks through new screens and tries new things online. So, as we confront “edtech trials” please feel free to raise your hand if you need help. Please tell Jennifer or email <a href="mailto:info@english-now.com">info@english-now.com</a> about specific training requests.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Thank you all for your flexibility, adaptability, and for caring for each other well. Please keep an eye on your own and each other’s well-being – and consider this topic a priority for our community in the coming months.</p>
    <br>
