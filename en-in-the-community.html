        <h1>Partnering to Support International Residents of the Washington, D.C. Area &amp; International Students</h1>
        <img src="images/Potluck.jpg" alt="An English Now Potluck">
        <p>English Now!'s staff is comprised of educators who find great joy in serving international residents of the Washington, D.C., area as well as visiting international students. We strive to meet the specific language education needs of our students.
            At the same time, we aim to help our students thrive in the U.S. as they adjust to a new culture and community- a goal we share with other organizations that work with international families.</p>
        <h4>Shared Goals - Supporting International Residents and Their Families</h4>
        <p>Do you and your organization want to help internationals thrive during their time in the U.S.? English Now! works with many types of organizations to achieve this goal:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Schools that serve international learners;</li>
            <li>Embassies;</li>
            <li>International organizations, including their family organizations;</li>
            <li>Non-profit organizations with missions that we share; and</li>
            <li>Businesses with international staff.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We welcome the opportunity to work with your organization in providing support to international residents and short-term visitors.</p>
        <h4>Tools and Resources for You &amp; Your Organization</h4>
        <p>We describe programs, tools and resources below that may be useful, and that may be part of our collaboration. <a href="contact-us">Contact us</a> if you have questions about any of the following - or better yet, please complete the webform to
            receive regular updates about public programs and additions to our community resources.</p>
        <h4>Programs on the U.S. Education System</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Fall Workshops for Parents with Children in U.S. Schools - We will hold Fall Workshops for parents at our school in Bethesda. These public programs - Succeeding in U.S. Schools ; Understanding Your Child's First Weeks of School - are designed
                to answer the many questions international families have about U.S. schools. These workshops will be held on Friday, September 4; and Friday, October 2, from 10:00 until 11:30am. Please download the flyer <a href="files/English%20Now%20-%20Understanding%20American%20Schools%20Workshop.pdf">here</a>.</li>

            <li>We also stock copies of an outstanding book by one of our partners, the Interchange Institute, called "Understanding American Schools: The Answers to Newcomers' Most Frequently Asked Questions". This is a great book for educators and for anyone
                who supports international families. See <a href="http://interchangeinstitute.org/html/schools.htm">here</a> for more information, or <a href="our-location">visit us</a> and peruse a copy.</li>

        </ul>
        <p>Resources Regarding English Language Education, for Educators or for Families</p>
        <ul>
            <li>We have had experience with thousands of non-native English speakers, supporting them in their studies of language and interactions with American culture.</li>
            <li>Our instructors and staff have developed this list of <a href="files/EnglishNow-RecommendedSupplementalResources-1.pdf">recommended resources</a>. Please feel free to download this, and to share it with your organization, and let us know if
                you would like to receive updates to the list as we make them.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Programs on Success in Cross-Cultural Interactions</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>We will offer a very special program on success in cross-cultural training, led by Dr, Anne Copeland, the Founder and Executive Director of the Interchange Institute, on Tuesday, November 2.</li>
            <li>Anne is a leading authority and noted speaker on cross-cultural issues, and we will be delighted to welcome members of the Washington, D.C.-area international community at the school for this program, and for Anne to share some of her insights.

        </ul>
        <h4>Programs on Parenting</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>One special program that is particularly helpful for newly arrived families is our "Parent Talk" conversation club, designed for mothers and their young children.</li>
            <li>This program is offered seasonally, Fall through Spring, on Tuesday afternoons and Friday mornings. Please encourage mothers who may lack the support network that they have in their home country, to <a href="contact-us">contact us</a> for
                more information.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>ENcompass: Information and Ideas for the International Community</h4>

            <li>We provide information online, as "ENcompass", that is designed to support international families' and students' transition to live in the U.S. Samples of articles include our recommendations - based on lots of experience - about the best
                things to do in the summer in and around Washington, D.C., and advice about the TOEFL test and applying for graduate schools. We invite you to read and share <a href="encompass">ENcompass</a>.</li>
