    <h1>Join the English Now! Team</h1>
    <p>English Now! has served the international community in Washington since 1991 and has a reputation for high levels of academic quality alongside strong attention to the social and emotional dimensions of learning. English Now!’s classes have a maximum class size of six, to ensure a highly interactive student experience and strong relationships between students and our instructors.</p>
    <p>English Now! does not have significant staff hiring needs, but we always want to meet people with a great English language teaching and international service background and do have needs to add people from time to time. Common needs include instructors with English for Specific Purposes teaching and professional experience, TOEFL test preparation backgrounds, and English for Professionals teaching experience.</p>
    <p>Sometimes people ask us about a “typical profile” of our successful instructors. This is a hard question to answer, because it is such a wonderfully diverse group! The only thing that we have noticed is that we do have quite a few Returned Peace Corps Volunteers on our team – this is not a requirement, but we see that people who served in the Peace Corps in the 1960s, 70s, 80s, or more recently often have teaching and life experience that enables them to engage well with our students.</p>
    <p>Requirements for applicants to serve as English Language Instructors at English Now! include: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>At least two years of experience teaching English to non-native English speakers – adults or children (please indicate your experience with each).</li>
        <li>Knowledge of classroom management techniques used with international adult and/or youth students.</li>
        <li>Ability to design curriculum for use in classes with international adult and/or youth students. We have a significant curriculum library and will always offer recommendations, but we encourage our instructors to select curriculum based on the needs of their student(s).</li>
        <li>Formal training in ESL instruction. This may have been completed in an academic context, Peace Corps/AmeriCorps, an intensive ESL training program, or training programs for volunteers.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>English Now! can be a great opportunity for enthusiastic individuals with English language teaching experience to serve international residents of the area and short-term visitors and grow in their profession. We invite you to submit a resume and cover letter to Paul Boesen, Managing Director, English Now!, <a href="" onclick="emailMe('info')">here</a>.</p>
