            <h3>Understanding U.S. Universities and the TOEFL Test</h3>
            <img src="images/encompass/college-map.jpg">
            <p>Some of our students want to study in the United States, at a college or university, and we are frequently asked about admissions
            requirements and college application processes. In addition, many students ask us about the TOEFL (or other) English language
            examinations required by American universities.</p>
            <p>We have prepared a resource for students that will help you think about pursuing higher education in the United States. Please feel
            free to download our <a href="files/English%20Now-%20-%20Higher%20Education%20FAQ.pdf">U.S. Higher Education FAQ</a> document, which addresses many of the common questions that people ask. For example, what is the difference between a college and a university? What are the TOEFL or other test requirements for undergraduate or graduate programs, in the U.S.?</p>
            <p>We are honored to have helped many students prepare for college or university in the United States and wish you well, if you are on
            this path!</p>

            <h3>Spotlight on a Teacher: Barbara Lewis</h3>
            <p>Barbara Lewis has been a wonderful member of the English Now! family for more than 10 years. Recently she was interviewed by English Now! instructor, Peggy Blair, about her long and exciting career. Barbara's teaching started in a very different context, as a Peace Corps volunteer in an African village in the 1960s:  "It was really hard for me. I was living in a small teachers' house in a small village teaching English to 44 students in one classroom with only a little blackboard." Learn more about Barbara below!</p>
            <h4>INTERVIEW WITH BARBARA LEWIS CONDUCTED BY PEGGY BLAIR</h4>
            <p><em>Where did you grow up, Barbara?</em></p>
            <p>I spent age six to sixteen in the Persian Gulf on Bahrain Island where my father was a doctor for an oil company. There was a community of foreigners living there, predominantly British, Australian, Canadian, and a few Americans. The school I attended till the age of 13 was a British day school.</p>
            <p><em>What was your family like?</em></p>
            <p>I had an older sister and a younger brother -- I still do. We were very close because we were on our own living together in a foreign country. My father spent a lot of time with his children teaching us how to play baseball and chess and that kind of thing. He would come home in the evenings and we would have family activities together -- and that was not usual during that era. It’s not so unusual now, but it was back then.</p>
            <p><em>Where did you go to college and what did you study?</em></p>
            <p>I started out at Pomona College in southern California. While I was there, there was an exchange program with Fisk University [a traditionally black college] in Nashville, Tennessee. I was one of only three whites studying there at the time of the civil rights protests. I participated in one of the lunch counter sit-ins at Walgreen’s [trying to get them to serve black people as well as white people] and I was arrested [she spent 48 hours in jail!].</p>
            <p>My mother was upset about all the publicity and the hate mail she received, so she forced me to come home (my father had died two years earlier when I was 16). Then I went to France to be an “au pair,” but soon realized that I had to finish college. So I went to University of Michigan at Ann Arbor (same school as Paul Boesen went to) where I majored in English because I loved reading so much.</p>
            <p><em>Why and when did you join the Peace Corps [a U.S. program started by President John Kennedy that sent volunteers to work for two years in developing countries]?</em></p>
            <p>The Peace Corps was a natural for me. Don’t forget that President Kennedy gave his famous speech announcing the Peace Corps at the University of Michigan. A lot of the college students enrolled right then and there. I had been admitted to the State Department but it took so long for them that in the meantime I joined the Peace Corps and went to Guinea in Africa (1963-1965).</p>
            <p><em>Did the Peace Corps experience change you in any way?</em></p>
            <p>Well, you start out so idealistically and think you’re going to make a real difference, but it’s you who changes, not the country. It was really hard for me. I was living in a small teachers’ house in a small village teaching English to 44 students in one classroom with only a little blackboard. I was very isolated. We were among the first Americans to go over there after independence. The man who worked in the post office hated Americans and burned all our mail, so we never even got letters from home. And of course there were no telephones or Internet!</p>
            <p><em>Any other jobs you had that were interesting?</em></p>
            <p>I taught English in Bangladesh, Egypt, Romania, Zambia; and in Amman, Jordon (where I taught fourth grade at an international school). I also taught special education [children with disabilities] in the U.S. for many years.</p>
            <p><em>Your family?</em></p>
            <p>I have a son who works in human resources at the Marriott in Pittsburg, Pennsylvania, and I have a daughter who works as a diplomat in China. I have three grandchildren.</p>
            <p><em>You’ve traveled so much. What country did you find most interesting?</em></p>
            <p>Impossible to say! Every country has its charms. Romania was fascinating when I was there. It was just coming out from under Communist control. And in the countryside, it was like being back in the Middle Ages -- you’d see people with plows, no electricity, and beautiful old churches. But I also loved Africa -- all the animals and safaris and parks, and climbing Mount Kilimanjaro, and snorkeling and deep sea diving and all those outdoor activities. Zambia was filled with music -- everybody seemed to be singing all the time there. And I loved tracking the places in the Bible in Jordan. I also loved teaching the Palestinian children, so eager to learn, more eager than in any other place.</p>
            <p><em>Any future travel plans?</em></p>
            <p>Well, I just got back from Indonesia where I had a wonderful trip. I think the next trip will be to Germany. My nephew works for the United Nations in Bonn, and my sister and I want to visit him.</p>
            <p><em>Thank you, Barbara, for your years of service to so many students at English Now!</em></p>

            <h3>Spotlight on an Instructor: Peggy Blair</h3>
            <p>Margaret Whitman Blair (“Peggy”) is a fantastic instructor, with a special love of teaching writing. She's even a published author! Meet Peggy below!</p>
            <p><em>How did you decide that you wanted to be a teacher?</em></p>
            <p>I guess it all started with my own teachers when I was young, several of who insisted that I should be a teacher. One was so sure of this that she invited me to teach The Great Gatsby to our class! I did enjoy that, but still, I wasn’t so sure. In my young mind, being a teacher sounded a bit boring, actually. Well, I think I can now admit that those teachers were right---I enjoy teaching so much!</p>
            <p>My first real teaching position was in Osaka, Japan. I had studied Japanese (and French) at university, and had been an exchange student in Japan, so I was very happy to find a way to return there after I graduated. It was a wonderful experience, although this was in 1973-74, the time of the energy crisis, so I do remember that the winter was extremely cold!</p>
            <p>I taught in DC for a while after that, but my next big teaching job was with the Peace Corps. I lived and taught in a teacher’s training college, a few hours from Bangkok, Thailand for a little over two years. I also met my husband there!</p>
            <p>During the Peace Corps, I did a lot of traveling in Southeast Asia and after that I worked on a kibbutz in Israel sorting apples, and backpacked around the Greek Islands and traveled through Europe. I then went back to school to earn a Master’s degree in International Relations, and spent many years as a journalist covering international trade issues. I loved that—the writing, the press conferences, the deadlines, and the whole field. I needed to scale back on that work when I had my first child (Matt, now 29), and left it entirely some time after our second (David, now 26) arrived. That’s when I turned to fiction writing.</p>
            <p><em>How exactly did you become a writer?</em></p>
            <p>I started writing screenplays with a partner, when I had young children, which was fun, but never really took off. My first book idea actually came from my eldest son, Matthew. He was 8 or 9 at the time, and was very interested in the Civil War. So we read book after book, watched movies, and went to Civil War “re-enactments.” Because my two boys used to fight quite a bit, I was inspired to write about two present day brothers who argued a lot and while in a Civil War re-enactment, went back in time, finding themselves on opposite sides in the Civil War. My son Matt was my first reader and editor!</p>
            <p><em>How did you get the ideas for your other five books?</em></p>
            <p>After the first historical fiction novel, they followed fairly naturally. It helped that I was an interviewer on a cable TV show at that time, called “Out of the Past,” which allowed me to talk with historians and others knowledgeable about different eras and events in history. So I got new ideas that way, and was also able to do a lot of my research through the show once I had the idea, too. For example, I interviewed a woman who was one of the early female pilots around the time of the 1929 “Powder Puff Derby,” which later became fodder for my book called The Roaring Twenty: The First Cross-Country Air Race for Women.</p>
            <p><em>How did you come to teach at English Now!?</em></p>
            <p>After my boys grew up, I felt a little isolated, though I was a member of many writers’ groups, and I taught at the Writer’s Center in Bethesda (courses on writing historical novels). I heard about English Now! in 2008 and I knew that I wanted to go back to my first love, teaching, and I have been happily teaching here ever since.</p>
            <p><em>What is your favorite part of being a teacher?</em></p>
            <p>It’s hard to pick one favorite, as there are so many nice moments, but if I had to choose, I would say that my favorite experience is when a student is able to communicate at a deeper level, and share his or her feelings, or an experience with me. When a student explains or describes something in a way that I can immediately understand, in a way that communicates their personality, especially when previously they couldn’t really express themselves well---I am thrilled! And I do love to share a good laugh with a student. That makes my day!</p>
            <p><em>What is different about English Now! compared to other places that you have taught?</em></p>
            <p>There is a wonderful energy at English Now!, I find. Also, the teachers here are given the opportunity to be themselves. We are given the freedom to teach in the way that we think is best, to really look at each student, and tailor-make a program for that individual student’s needs. I have taught at places like Berlitz, and it is not such a fun experience, because you have to use only the Berlitz method, and only the Berlitz books. That can be very stifling. I think the English Now! way is much more effective for our students, as is the smaller class size at English Now!.</p>
            <p><em>What are your hobbies, besides writing?</em>
            <p>Well, I can really sympathize with my students at English Now! because I am currently studying Spanish, and it sure isn’t easy! But I do enjoy learning new languages, and I also enjoy bicycling and doing crossword puzzles.</p>
            <p><em>What book are you working on now?</em></p>
            <p>I am working on a mystery novel set in 1882 Siam (Thailand). It does require a lot of research, though, and the plot is complicated, so it is going very slowly. Plus, I just had my hip replaced, which has also slowed me down a bit!</p>
            <p><em>What is your favorite place to visit in the United States?</em></p>
            <p>Oh, it is so hard to choose! There are many: I love the Southwest, southeastern Utah, Santa Fe, and also the Pacific Northwest. Here on the East Coast, I like Block Island (RI) and the Florida Keys.</p>
            <p><em>What else would you want your students to know about you?</em></p>
            <p>That I love my sons, and I miss them very much! Matthew is in Providence RI, working as a lawyer for people with disabilities. And David is involved in the opening of a high-end “small plate”/tapas restaurant in Madison, WI. I do have 2 cats, whom I also love, but they can’t fill the boys’ shoes!</p>
            <p>My husband Bob is an economist, working on antitrust issues with the Federal Maritime Commission. He also teaches poetry writing on Wednesday mornings, at Miriam’s Kitchen (which serves homeless people). He has even had a poem published, in fact, so there are now two writers in the family! We have been happily married for 37 years.</p>
            <p>I think that’s all I’d like to add!</p>
