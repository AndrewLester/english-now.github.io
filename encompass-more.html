            <img src="images/encompass/college-map.jpg">
            <p>Some of our students want to study in the United States, at a college or university, and we are frequently asked about admissions requirements and college application processes. In addition, many students ask us about the TOEFL (or other) English language examinations required by American universities.</p>
            <p>We have prepared a resource for students that will help you think about pursuing higher education in the United States. Please feel free to download our <a href="files/Higher-Education-FAQ.doc">U.S. Higher Education FAQ</a> document, which addresses many of the common questions that people ask. For example, what is the difference between a college and a university? What are the TOEFL or other test requirements for undergraduate or graduate programs, in the U.S.?
            </p>
            <p>We are honored to have helped many students prepare for college or university in the United States and wish you well, if you are on this path!</p>

            <h3>Still More Things to Do in the Fall…Maryland Renaissance Festival</h3>
            <img src=images/encompass/Rennaisance.jpg>
            <p>And this is another great way to spend an afternoon or a day, in September or October.....</p>
            <p>The Renaissance Festival brings medieval fun to Crownsville, Maryland (one hour from Bethesda) from late August through mid-October. This is the second largest Renaissance Festival in the nation.</p>
            <p>Set in a fictional 16th-century English village named Revel Grove, the festival is spread over twenty-five acres (100,000 m2) of woods and fields. There are more than one hundred thirty craft shops and forty-two food outlets. There are more than two hundred performers on stages and as “characters” walking throughout the village.</p>
            <p>This is a little bit like a medieval version of Disneyland!</p>
            <p>People of all ages can enjoy performances at eight major theaters and four smaller stages in taverns. There is also a children's area full of activities. Go back in time with comedy shows, fire eaters, sword swallowers, juggling acts, Celtic music. Walk among knights, maidens, pirates, and villagers in puffy shirts, and feast on turkey legs at big wooden tables. And don’t miss the jousting tiltyard with seating for 3,000! Watch a fight between mounted knights wearing armor and using lances, just as they would have at a medieval tournament, where knights would practice various forms of combat to the delight, and for the amusement, of crowds of onlookers.</p>
            <p>Dates for Fall 2015 are: Sept 20, 26 &amp; 27 and October 3, 4, 10, 11, 17, 18, 24 &amp; 25.</p>
            <p>Location: 1821 Crownsville Road, Annapolis, Maryland 21401; note that this is not far from the beautiful seaside town of Annapolis, Maryland. Consider visiting Annapolis for a meal before or after the festival.</p>
            <p>Admission: Thru 9/17: $17/ages 16 and up, $8/ages 7-15. 9/22-10/21: $22/ages 16 and up, $10/ages 7-15. Free for ages 6 and under.</p>
            <p>To avoid waiting in line, you can <a href=http://rennfest.com>buy tickets online</a> before you go. And be sure to google “Maryland Renaissance Festival coupons” before you go to get discounts!</p>

            <h3>Spotlight on a Teacher: Barbara Lewis</h3>
            <p>Barbara Lewis has been a wonderful member of the English Now! family for more than 10 years. Recently she was interviewed by English Now! instructor, Peggy Blair, about her long and exciting career. Barbara's teaching started in a very different context, as a Peace Corps volunteer in an African village in the 1960s: "It was really hard for me. I was living in a small teachers' house in a small village teaching English to 44 students in one classroom with only a little blackboard." Learn more about Barbara below!</p>
            <h4>INTERVIEW WITH BARBARA LEWIS CONDUCTED BY PEGGY BLAIR</h4>
            <p>
                <em>Where did you grow up, Barbara?</em>
            </p>
            <p>I spent age six to sixteen in the Persian Gulf on Bahrain Island where my father was a doctor for an oil company. There was a community of foreigners living there, predominantly British, Australian, Canadian, and a few Americans. The school I attended till the age of 13 was a British day school.</p>
            <p>
                <em>What was your family like?</em>
            </p>
            <p>I had an older sister and a younger brother -- I still do. We were very close because we were on our own living together in a foreign country. My father spent a lot of time with his children teaching us how to play baseball and chess and that kind of thing. He would come home in the evenings and we would have family activities together -- and that was not usual during that era. It’s not so unusual now, but it was back then.</p>
            <p>
                <em>Where did you go to college and what did you study?</em>
            </p>
            <p>I started out at Pomona College in southern California. While I was there, there was an exchange program with Fisk University [a traditionally black college] in Nashville, Tennessee. I was one of only three whites studying there at the time of the civil rights protests. I participated in one of the lunch counter sit-ins at Walgreen’s [trying to get them to serve black people as well as white people] and I was arrested [she spent 48 hours in jail!].</p>
            <p>My mother was upset about all the publicity and the hate mail she received, so she forced me to come home (my father had died two years earlier when I was 16). Then I went to France to be an “au pair,” but soon realized that I had to finish college. So I went to University of Michigan at Ann Arbor (same school as Paul Boesen went to) where I majored in English because I loved reading so much.</p>
            <p>
                <em>Why and when did you join the Peace Corps [a U.S. program started by President John Kennedy that sent volunteers to work for two years in developing countries]?</em>
            </p>
            <p>The Peace Corps was a natural for me. Don’t forget that President Kennedy gave his famous speech announcing the Peace Corps at the University of Michigan. A lot of the college students enrolled right then and there. I had been admitted to the State Department but it took so long for them that in the meantime I joined the Peace Corps and went to Guinea in Africa (1963-1965).</p>
            <p>
                <em>Did the Peace Corps experience change you in any way?</em>
            </p>
            <p>Well, you start out so idealistically and think you’re going to make a real difference, but it’s you who changes, not the country. It was really hard for me. I was living in a small teachers’ house in a small village teaching English to 44 students in one classroom with only a little blackboard. I was very isolated. We were among the first Americans to go over there after independence. The man who worked in the post office hated Americans and burned all our mail, so we never even got letters from home. And of course there were no telephones or Internet!</p>
            <p>
                <em>Any other jobs you had that were interesting?</em>
            </p>
            <p>I taught English in Bangladesh, Egypt, Romania, Zambia; and in Amman, Jordon (where I taught fourth grade at an international school). I also taught special education [children with disabilities] in the U.S. for many years.</p>
            <p>
                <em>Your family?</em>
            </p>
            <p>I have a son who works in human resources at the Marriott in Pittsburg, Pennsylvania, and I have a daughter who works as a diplomat in China. I have three grandchildren.</p>
            <p>
                <em>You’ve traveled so much. What country did you find most interesting?</em>
            </p>
            <p>Impossible to say! Every country has its charms. Romania was fascinating when I was there. It was just coming out from under Communist control. And in the countryside, it was like being back in the Middle Ages -- you’d see people with plows, no electricity, and beautiful old churches. But I also loved Africa -- all the animals and safaris and parks, and climbing Mount Kilimanjaro, and snorkeling and deep sea diving and all those outdoor activities. Zambia was filled with music -- everybody seemed to be singing all the time there. And I loved tracking the places in the Bible in Jordan. I also loved teaching the Palestinian children, so eager to learn, more eager than in any other place.</p>
            <p>
                <em>Any future travel plans?</em>
            </p>
            <p>Well, I just got back from Indonesia where I had a wonderful trip. I think the next trip will be to Germany. My nephew works for the United Nations in Bonn, and my sister and I want to visit him.</p>
            <p>
                <em>Thank you, Barbara, for your years of service to so many students at English Now!</em>
            </p>

            <h3>Spotlight on a Student: My First Year in the United States, by Ioanna Galani</h3>
            <img src=images/encompass/IoannaGalani.jpg>
            <p>
                <em>Note: we were fortunate to meet and have the chance to work with a wonderful student from Greece named Ioanna Galani when she arrived in the U.S. late last year. These words are entirely her own. We share them as wonderful testimony to the experiences that so many of our students have in the U.S.</em>
            </p>
            <p>My story starts in the beginning of October 2014 when I first came in the United States from Greece. It was an unexpected chance, but I took it without a second thought. I am nineteen years old and as you understand that encouraged me to come to the land of opportunity. I did not know what I will do here or how is life in the United States, so I had so many questions going through my mind about if I am going to make it or not.</p>
            <p>Usually when you go to a new country the first months are like a honeymoon because you fall in love with everything, such as culture, sights and food. The first months that I was here it was a cultural shock. So, I said to myself that I am big girl and I should think about what I need to do with my future. First of all, I felt the need for communication, which was impeded due to the lack of fluency in the English language. I have studied English back in Greece, but when you actually live in the United States you realize that you are not fluent enough to communicate effectively. As a result, I found English Now!, which was a school not only to improve your English, but also to meet new people from all over the world and learn things about the country that you live in. This period I felt really blessed that I was there. My verbal communication improved a lot, I met professors eager to learn about me and I also socialized.</p>
            <p>After several months l left from English Now! and I decided to go to the Montgomery College. It was a very stressful period in my life because I was trying to figure out for what classes I need to register for and how the college works. The Spring Semester began in January and I was ready to see how college in the United States was. In the beginning, I was worried, but after some weeks I felt comfortable with everything. I found some people to hang out with in the college and at the same time I was thinking what my major will be and to what university I want to transfer. Furthermore, in Greece I was an athlete and I decided to play for the college women's volleyball team and hopefully for the university women's volleyball team that I would like to transfer.</p>
            <p>Moreover, I was searching about a volunteer job because I thought that it would be beneficial for my resume for the university. One day in the college there was a volunteer fair and I heard about a volunteer job that was very interesting. It was a program, which was called ''Girls on the run'' and very soon I contacted them to go and coach those girls. This program offered me the chance to view another aspect of myself. It wasn't about only running, it was about who you are, what habits, values and beliefs you should establish and to know to appreciate yourself and the others. As a coach of those girls I didn’t have the responsibility only to teach how to run but also I had to successfully convey to them those important values. It wasn’t easy…Girls in this age have a lot of questions. Although the questions seemed simple, surprisingly I had to find out a multidimensional answer.</p>
            <p>The Spring Semester finished up, I got excellent grades, the girls ran and did their best and it was time to start taking the courses that were related to my major. My major was Kinesiology and during the first summer session I took Math and Biology. I had a hard time because the summer session was accelerated and I didn’t have the best foundation for those courses. I was feeling stressed during this period, and the only thing that I did it was studying because I was trying to catch up with the rest of the class. After this, I decided to change my major to Psychology, which I truly like. I had taken some classes in high school that were relevant to my field of studies. To be honest, I was never really excited about Kinesiology, yet I wanted to try it before I rejected it. Psychology is a field that offers you the chance to apply psychology to real life. In other words, you are able to use psychological concepts to interpret human experience. Second, another requirement of Psychology is the continuous research which helps you have a deeper understanding not only about the people around, but also of yourself. Furthermore, it is not a major that restricts you to study only Psychology, but provides you a broad connection with other fields, such as Communication. So, I feel satisfied with my decision to study Psychology and the classes that I am taking right now in the college are really interesting.</p>
            <p>After the end of the first summer session the summer began. I missed my family back in Greece, but at the same time I was excited that I had the chance to be here. I think the majority of people who live and study in other countries have the same feelings. My summer, it was nice. I had the opportunity to rest a little bit and to discover things on my own. Moreover, I took the chance to improve more in volleyball as almost every day I had practice. However, volleyball for me is much more than a sport. . I love to play volleyball and it is an integral part of my daily life. I believe that sports and for me volleyball, drives you to hold your own, to realize that you should become responsible, honest, independent and self-reliant in order to deal with your problems and find solutions. I’ve been through many difficult moments due to injuries and personal problems, but volleyball was always there for me and it was an important reminder of what kind of person I want to be.</p>
            <p>The summer seemed short and the Fall Semester started. My schedule is really tight, I have four classes, yet I chose to continue playing volleyball in the Montgomery College Women’s Volleyball Team. I do not regret that I still play volleyball because I want to combine my studies with sports and someday play at the university level.</p>
            <p>Right now is September 20th and I am in the process of studying, practicing and doing the best that I can to transfer to a four-year-university. I understand that is not easy but I am more than eager to fulfill this dream. Coming to the United States, I met a different world with so many opportunities to be highly educated and to do what you really desire. However, there is a lot of competition and many difficulties that consciously or unconsciously lead you to strengthen yourself.</p>
            <p>In conclusion, I strongly believe that if you want to achieve something you should not be affected by external factors and you should adjust yourself to the reality. I am still young and the only thing that I can express with certainty is that I will keep fighting for my dreams. This is what everybody should do!</p>
