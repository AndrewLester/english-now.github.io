    <p>Afternoon Summer Youth Program, for Children Ages Eight to Twelve</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Our Summer Youth Program meets four days per week, on Mondays through Thursdays, from 2:30 until 4:30 pm. These classes are taught as semi-private lessons with a formal curriculum. Classes also include significant experiential learning (music, drama, art, activities in the neighborhood, etc.).</li>
        <li>This program is available from late June through August, each year.</li>
        <li>Students are invited to participate in our regular Friday activities (visits to Washington, DC-area museums, monuments, etc.). A family member must accompany students 12 and under to activities.</li>
        <li>Each semi-private lesson enrolls two to four students.</li>
        <li>Tuition is $200 per week. (Note: If only one student is enrolled at a given level of English proficiency, the class will be taught as a 90-minute private lesson, but tuition will remain the same. If the class size reaches four students, the class will be extended to two and a half hours at no additional charge.)</li>
        <li>There is a one-time $40 registration fee. For classes that use textbooks, there is a charge of $40 for books &amp; materials.</li>
        <li>Minimum registration is for two weeks of classes.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>After School or Weekend Private Lessons, for Children Ages Five to Twelve</p>
    <ul>
        <li>These classes are tailored to the needs of the family and the student(s). Lessons are most often in a private or semi-private format. Our instructors are able to structure lessons to best match the needs of the student as well as the student's daytime school curriculum.</li>
        <li>During the summer, private lessons for children and youth meet twice a week, either Monday and Wednesday from 4:30 until 5:30pm, OR Tuesday and Thursday from 4:30 to 5:30pm. We may suggest a longer lesson for older students. Some instructors may also be available for private lessons on Fridays or Saturdays. Ask us when instructors are available.</li>
        <li>Between September and June, private lessons for children and youth are usually held in the afternoons or on Saturday morning. Ask us when instructors are available.</li>
        <li>Students are invited to participate in our regular Friday activities (visits to Washington, DC-area museums, monuments, etc.). A family member must accompany students 12 and under to activities.</li>
        <li>Tuition for private lessons is $40 per hour for classes at the school. If an instructor is available to travel to a family's home, private lessons may sometimes be possible offsite for tuition of $50 per hour. In addition, there is a one-time $40 registration fee, and a $40 fee for books &amp; materials in classes that use textbooks.</li>
        <li>Minimum registration is for 10 hours of lessons.</li>
