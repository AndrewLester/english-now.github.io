    <h1>English Classes for Youth</h1>
    <img src="images/games.jpg">
    <p>English Now! offers English programs for children. Our programs enroll children from dozens of countries all over the world. We especially enjoy helping children of newly-arrived international residents of the Washington, D.C. area prepare for and succeed in school. We look forward to serving your family!</p>
    <p><strong>English Now! offers the following English classes for children and teens:</strong></p>
    <p><strong>After School or Weekend Private Lessons, for Children Ages Five to Twelve</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Purpose - These classes are tailored to the needs of the family and the student(s). Lessons are most often in a private or semi-private format. Our instructors are able to structure lessons to match the needs of the student as well as the student's daytime school curriculum.</li>
        <li>Relationship to Children's Studies in the School - We are fortunate to have many good ESOL programs in the schools in this area. However, we know that tutorial support will accelerate a student's path to proficiency and—especially for students that hesitate to speak out—help their oral proficiency and active vocabulary progress more quickly.</li>
        <li>Curriculum - We have a number of textbook and curriculum options available to support these lessons. Ask us for information about curriculum—we are glad to share our recommendations, based on work with many students over the years.</li>
        <li>Dates - Between September and June, private and semi-private lessons for children and youth typically meet in the afternoons after school at 3:00pm, 4:00pm or 5:00pm or on Saturday morning.</li>
        <li>Schedule - We schedule 10 minutes between lessons, for instructors and students to switch classes. That means that a one-hour tutorial lesson is held for 50 minutes. Some older students may take a one and a half hour lesson, which is scheduled for 80 minutes. Ask us when instructors are available. For lower level students (students in ESOL 1 and most in ESOL 2 classes in their school), we recommend private lessons at least two times per week, usually on Monday and Wednesday, or Tuesday and Thursday.</li>
        <li>Tuition - Tuition for private lessons is $40 per 50-minute session, for classes at the school. If an instructor is available to travel to a family's home, offsite private lessons may sometimes be possible offsite for tuition of $50 per hour, but availability for these lessons is very limited, and lessons are scheduled at students' homes for a minimum of one hour and 15 minutes. Tuition for semi-private lessons of two students is $28 per 50-minute session per student at the school, and $38 per hour per student offsite.</li>
        <li>Fees - In addition, there is a one-time $40 registration fee, and an additional charge for any books & materials.</li>
        <li>Registration - Lessons for youth are scheduled for the entire Fall or Spring Semesters.</li>
    </ul>

        <li>Curriculum - Curriculum is as varied as the needs of teenaged students in public and private schools, and we are glad to tailor lessons to the academic support, vocabulary development, and other needs of students. We also have special programs for teens that focus on writing, an especially important skill area for students that want to study at the university level in the U.S. For information about our Writing for Teens classes, see here.</li>
