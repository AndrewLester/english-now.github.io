    <h1>History</h1>
    <p>English Now! was founded in 1991 by two English teachers, Jan Rea and Anda Sztankay, and has served Washington, D.C.'s international community from its location in Bethesda for 25 years.</p>
    <img src="images/history.jpg" alt="Left to right:  Paul Boesen, English Now! Co-Founder Anda Sztankay, and Anne Copeland" title="Left to right:  Paul Boesen, English Now! Co-Founder Anda Sztankay, and Anne Copeland">
    <p>English Now! was inspired by Jan Rea’s experience as a student studying Italian language in a small town outside Siena, Italy. Jan had a wonderful experience studying in a small, Italian town. The atmosphere at the school was welcoming, class sizes were small, and the cultural experience was rich.</p>
    <p>Upon Jan’s return to the United States, Jan and Anda created English Now! to provide the same sort of experience to the Washington, D.C., international community. They created a very distinctive sort of language school. Classes are small, with a <em>maximum</em> of six students in group classes, and the school itself is small, still with only nine classrooms. Jan and Anda developed a uniquely personalized school culture that exudes warm and welcoming approach to learning.</p>
    <p>The school location itself has also always been distinctive. Originally operated from Jan’s and Anda’s homes, English Now! does not have a typical "institutional" atmosphere. The school moved twice in its early years, first into a small house on Montgomery Lane in Bethesda, Maryland, then in 1995 to another house at 4903 Montgomery Lane that would be its home for 20 years.</p>
    <img src="images/old-location.jpg">
    <p>We are no longer located in a house, but the school's culture is warm and will make you feel "at home." Though Jan and Anda have retired, the atmosphere they created remains. We are honored that Anda, in the middle in the photo above, serves on our Advisory Board, and we consider her a friend and appreciate the spirit that she developed at the school.</p>
    <p><strong>English Now! Today</strong></p>
    <p>English Now! is <a href="en-in-the-community">doing more than ever to engage our community</a>!
