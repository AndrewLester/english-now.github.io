    <h1>Express Yourself with Confidence in English</h1>
    <img src="images/english-for-professionals.jpg">
    <p>Our English for Professionals program is designed for professionals that want to be more effective working in English. Most of our students have already studied English for some time and are already working or studying in an English language environment. However, they realize that high-level language proficiency can be an enormous advantage and they are willing to invest time in this program to meet their professional goals.</p>
    <p>At English Now!, our students’ goals become our goals, and we help them to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Succeed in today's job market by improving their English communication competency/skills.</li>
        <li>Improve their confidence, comfort and productivity through an English for Professionals curriculum customized to their needs.</li>
        <li>Excel in their careers by refining their presentation skills, English vocabulary and/or professional writing.</li>
        <li>Focus on issues specifically relevant to their work, especially in private lessons with field-specific curriculum, such as Economics, Business, Marketing, Health Care, Government Relations or Development.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Our classes are small.</strong> The maximum number of students in our group classes is six, ensuring that each student receives significant attention. Many students choose to enroll in private lessons alongside group classes, to ensure personalized attention to their specific needs.</p>
    <p><strong>Our curriculum is relevant.</strong> We use engaging, multimedia curricula drawn from sources such as <a href="http://ted.com">TED talks</a>, <a href="http://npr.com">National Public Radio</a>, <a href="http://voanews.com">Voice of America</a>. In addition, our instructors often use a Cambridge University Press book series called Professional English in Use, which gives us the ability to focus on English for fields including Health Care/Medicine, Marketing, Law, ICT, Engineering, Construction, Media, and more. Our Business English students have even more resources to draw on. Our students complete listening exercises, speak to persuade, write essays and prepare presentations on topics that relate to a professionals’ communication needs.</p>
    <p><strong>Expect yourself to be challenged in this environment.</strong> Expect to meet a fantastic group of classmates from all over the world. Our English for Professionals students in Saturday classes sometimes even go on outings together.</p>

    <h4>Understand How You Engage in the Workplace</h4>
    <p>In addition to strong language skills, success in an American, English-language work environment requires cross-cultural competencies as well as an understanding of one's own strengths and weaknesses. Operating outside one's home culture is demanding. It requires strong "soft skills" and an ability to confront challenges with perseverance and humility. At the same time, it is rewarding personally and professionally to interact with Americans and others in Washington, D.C.'s unique environment - and your work can have a greater impact here than in most other cities, if it is done well.</p>
    <p>English Now! also offers Myers Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) assessments for our students, to complement our language classes. The MBTI helps you understand your work style, including: how you manage your time, problem solving, best approaches for decision making, and dealing with stress. Knowledge of type can help you better understand the culture of your workplace, how to participate in teams, and how to relate to colleagues. We can administer the official MBTI in any of 28 different languages, to control for language differences. Debrief sessions are conducted in English with a certified MBTI trainer and member of our faculty, Elizabeth Boesen.</p>
    <p>For more information on the MBTI and how it may help you better engage in your professional environment, please contact Elizabeth at <a href="" onclick="emailMe('elizabeth.boesen')">elizabeth.boesen@english-now.com</a> or visit us.</p>
