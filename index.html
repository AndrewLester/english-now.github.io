    <p>We take a distinctive approach to English language study. Our students benefit from personalized instruction in unusually small classes. Our group classes enroll a <u>maximum</u> of six students, and many classes are even smaller.

    <p><strong>Enjoy.</strong> We offer a warm, welcoming atmosphere to a wonderfully diverse group of students.
